This repository brings together Fulltext and PDFs from Print at Penn's [Digital Collection of British & American Fiction, 1660-1830](http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/print/index.html) and corresponding metadata produced by the Early Novels Dataset. 


The University of Pennsylvania Libraries' Collection of British & American Fiction, 1660-1830 (CBAF) numbers nearly three thousand works that together form a rich teaching and research collection of early fiction in English. While drawing from the general Rare Books Collection as well as several smaller named collections, its core is the Singer-Mendenhall Collection, built through the combined efforts of a University of Pennsylvania graduate student and professor in the first half of the twentieth century. Godfrey F. Singer and John C. Mendenhall each accumulated working collections of mainly epistolary fiction; Singer's parents donated his books to the University of Pennsylvania Library after his death in 1934, and Mendenhall added his library in 1950. Since then, the Singer-Mendenhall collection has augmented its initial strengths in epistolary fiction with rare, non-canonical works published by female or anonymous authors. The CBAF includes a number of works that are unique to Penn on the title or edition level, among them *Frederick and Alicia* (1791), *The Cautious Lover* (1773), and *An Interesting Sketch of Genteel Life* (1782). The first instalment of the Digital Collection of British & American offers 73 epistolary novels published between 1700 and 1799, including these unique titles and other works by female or anonymous authors that are not readily available in digital form elsewhere. 


To complement the page images available through the Penn Libraries digital collections interface, we here offer these titles in [PDF](<https://upenn.box.com/s/t9su0mz1qtv5qtm4s3hhfjjthvk485pg>) and [text](<https://github.com/earlynovels/digital-collection/tree/master/PaP-END-fulltexts>) format for ease of access and use. PDFs have been OCRed with Abbyy FineReader using a recognition pattern hand-trained on this corpus to recognize eighteenth-century type. The full-text files have been further remediated using a customized set of rules and Ted Underwoodâ€™s OCR [normalizer](<https://tedunderwood.com/2013/12/10/a-half-decent-ocr-normalizer-for-english-texts-after-1700>). 
Early Novels Dataset metadata for each title is available as [individual MARC XML records](<https://github.com/earlynovels/digital-collection/tree/master/PaP-END-xml-records>); that and other metadata is also included in [tabular form](<https://github.com/earlynovels/digital-collection/blob/master/PaP-metadata-refined.csv>). Use this [Google Sheet](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jjRukUJSpJ3IKLzbkdyWdbfEE6ayzdYgD0KuEb5lBE/edit?usp=sharing>) to locate the corresponding END MARCXML record, fulltext file, and PDF for each Print at Penn digital surrogate.
