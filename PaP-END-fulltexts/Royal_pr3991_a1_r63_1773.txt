PREFACE
TO THE
R E A D E R.

At a time when there is so great a dearth of good writers, it is, almost needless to say any thing in favour of the following work. The town has long been pestered with novels. The vitiated taste of youth, owing to the perusal of such productions, is an undeniable proof of the great necessity of exploding the publication of all similar works, which most deservedly merits to be consigned to eternal oblivion. The adventurers of an imaginary being is generally the theme of these writings: An abandoned female, a profligate rake, or a reformed debauchee, the principal events of whose life are treated of in books of this sort


( iv )

are the general topic; these are daily offered to the perusal of the idle and dissipated, and the minds of young people are corrupted by that which ought to be the source of instruction and entertainment. They either become acquainted with scenes of intrigue and wickedness to which they were before utter strangers, or, which is equally as bad, their minds are filled with ideas of incidents as impropable as they are absurd. Thus the original design of novels is entirely perverted. They were at first intended to instruct, at the same time that they muse the reader; but alas! the state of virtue is become so degenerate, that nothing is favourably received but what teems with obscenity of language and profligacy of sentiment. To this cause-also may be justly attributed the never to be sufficiently lamented depravity of manners. Young people of both sexes, who were once renowned for being the brightest examples of the most exalted virtue, are now become the scorn of

( V )

their acquaintance; and that goodness of heart which once seemed to be the sole spring of all their actions, is seen no more, and vice now rears her standard, where virtue lately displayed her banners. To stem this torrent of evil, and to restore virtue to its pristine lustre is the most ardent wish of the author of the following sheets. From the subsequent short sketch, the reader will be enabled to form a proper judgment of the whole work. The story is very interesting, the incidents are related in the most correct, clear and concise method imaginable; the language is pure and chaste; all expressions which might afford the lightest shadow of corruption are studiously avoided, and the utmost care has been taken to insert nothing but what will tend to instruct: and reform, as well as amuse the mind of the reader as this is the scope which the author has prescribed to himself, he doubts not in the least of meeting with the approbation of all those who

( vi )

shall take the pains of perusing this work, which if he is so happy as to meet with, he will ever entertain a grateful rememberance of the favour conferred on him, and will endeavour to testify his most sincere acknowledgement by dedicating his labours to the service of those who honour them with their countenance. As he has neither the views of honours or interest to influence him, he flatters himself that he has gained the summit of his desires, by having produced a work which, at the same time that it delights, conveys the most instructive lessons of virtue. He therefore takes the liberty of recommending his work to the attention of the polite youth of both sexes, and flatters himself that their approbation of his endeavours to plese them will crown his attempts. It may perhaps be objected that he has introduced none but persons in the most exalted stations of life; but it must be remembered that VIRTUE alone should

( vii )

be the distinguishing characteristic of every class, and that without this ornament all our actions lose their merit. If he is so happy as to afford any pleasure to his readers, he will esteem his labours overpaid, and will rejoice at having been the happy means of contributing somewhat towards the reformation of the British youth. This is his first attempt; he therefore flatters himself that he shall meet with the approbation of those who do not blush at being thought good. It is needless to say any further of a work, which the author would wish should recommend itself by its merit alone, contrary to the general run of our modern productions, which usually make their way into the world by dint of the most flagrant impudence of those who endeavour, by a well qritten title-page to alure the wretched effects of their mistaken genius or the too credulous public.

THE TEST OF FRIENDSHIP
	
CHAP I.
The birth of Thalmeno—At the age of fifteen he resolves privately to leave his father’s court.—Palmos is informed of his intention, and determines to accompany him.
They elope together—embark on board a vessel—and land safely on the African shore.

In the island of Cecilia, situated in the center of the Mediterranean sea, there reigned a monarch named DRUYNO, endued with every virtue that could adorn the prince; he swayed the regal scepter

with the universal applauses of a grateful people; who, considering him as the guardian of their liberties, and the source of the tranquillity which they enjoyed under his government.—To his skill in martial affairs he had added a knowledge of every other science, that at once elevates and adorns the mind.—At this time peace blest his happy isle, and that he might contribute as much as possible to the happiness of his subjects, he constantly resided among them.

But alas! his own felicity was incomplete! for though he married when only eighteen years of age, he had no issue to succeed to his crown—and GRATIANA, his consort, was scarcely fourteen when she became the partner of the royal bed. His head, with age was almost silver’d o’er; the lily and the rose had faded on Gratiana’s cheeks, where once they
triumphed blooming and unrivaled.

	And eagles change their aged plumes  
	The faded rose each spring receives 	
	A fresh red tincture on her leaves:

However, to the universal joy of the kingdom in general, and Druyno in particular, the queen’s pregnancy was announced, when all hopes of such an event had been totally given up; at length, the long wished-for blessing arrives; a prince is born—and nothing but acclamations are heard throughout the island.—The temples resounded with hymns of gratitude to the gods—their praises were chanted in every grove—and caroled through every street. Foreigners, who happened to be there, viewed with pleasure and surprize the magnificence with which they solemnized this auspicious day, when the subjects of so good a king seemed emulous

to excel each other in giving demonstrations of their joy. Without carrying our readers into the nursery, and informing them with what tenderness and assiduity parental fondness watched over his infantile years, we shall only observe that at a very early age, when others are amused with toys, THALMENO, (for so was the young prince named) had acquired an uncommon degree of skill in martial exercizes, which were his delight; and so great was his proficiency in this kind of study, that ere he attained the years of maturity, he gave the most flattering hopes of one day becoming an experienced and successful general; and in every respect worthy of his royal extraction.

As he grew up, his person bespoke his dignity—his complexion was beautifully
fair—his demeanour courteous—and for affability surpassed even Alexander himself; by nature formed to please, he took every

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 5

opportunity of improving prepossessions in his favour—from nature too he derived parts strong and lively, which, education had polished and improved.—From his tongue dropped the eloquent and enchanting phrases of his admired, Demosthenes. For his genius and learning, he soon acquired the reputation of the wife learned prince; for his manners, the character of the most amiable.

Thus distinguished by nature and by art, who had each so largely contributed to form our young prince, no wonder if he was beloved.—Had Pallas heard of his merit, she could not have withheld her approbation and praises of his perfections. —Juno, if she had feen his person, would, have forsaken her Jupiter; and the Syrens themselves, had they fixed their eyes upon his features, would have withdrawn their melody from timorous Ulysses, and tuned their

6 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

harmonious notes to hail only Thalmeno their favourite.

The royal parents viewed their rising, hopes in the bloomy spring of life with extacy of joy; nor did their piety want any incitement to their gratitude towards heaven for so sweet a son.-—They daily rendered millions of thanks to the propitious deity had thus blest their declining years with the precious boon, while the happy citizens thronged to the temple of the goddess Fortune, to offer up their daily thanks for so inestimable a blessing as the young and gallant heir of their flourishing empire.

The herald had now proclaimed his sixteenth year—when, to improve his natural abilities and education—to experience what his princely fortunes might be-—and what events they might produce, he determines to travel.—The inclination was not to be opposed by any arguments his

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 7

his mind suggested—the resolution was private.—As often as he attempted to repress his eager desires of visiting foreign nations, of feeing the manners of people, and the customs of different countries, he found the talk too arduous to effect; and when he had sometimes thought the wish half-smothered by due reflection on the risk he should run, the desire broke out, afresh, as it were out of the embers where it had only lain concealed, not extinguished—at length it flamed, collecting greater force from its being suppressed for a time.

“Whatever the issue might be,” he would say to himself, “is to Thalmeno unknown—but whatever it might prove, whether fortunate or otherwise whether I shall live to be the wiser for my observations, or die in the attempt of becoming so is to me a matter of little moment. The gods must have inspired

8 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

me with the resolution, and I am determined to obey the impulse”

But this his private resolution, was not so secretly concealed, but that the news soon reached the cars of his cousin PALMOS, son and heir of BLITHGORA, king of Egypt; who, being well pleased with the report, could reap no perfect rest, until he had engaged himself a participator of his cousin’s adventurous proceedings. He therefore went in Search of Thalmeno, and familiarly discovered to him the news he had heard of his intentions, which the young prince no sooner understood, but he was overjoyed that he had found so princely a partner of his future fortunes: in consequence of this meeting, they resolved to depart immediately; and furnishing themselves with such necessaries as were befitting for their voyage, they secretly departed, directing their course to Trapani, one of the principal ports of Cecilia; where finding

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 9

a ship ready to sail, bound for Arabia, they instantly embarked, rejoicing that Fortune had so luckily provided for them a speedy passage, without making the king or the court in the least acquaint with their intentions. The young princes were soon missing, and for their absence, what sorrowful mournings and melancholy aggravations were seen in all places (especially in the palace royal) I leave to the delicate feelings of the susceptible reader.

CHAP. II.
After traveling through the Arabian deserts, they arrive at a castle inhabited by Florina, daughter of a Numidian king-, where making themselves known, their necessities are relieved, and furnished with means to pursue their travels

After a short and pleasant voyage, our royal adventurers attained the shore, and bountifully rewarding the crew, they betook themselves to their desperate adventures; where through the African deserts they so long had travelled, that at last, being destitute of food, and not finding wherewithal to suffice nature (these parts not being inhabited) passionately tracing these unknown groves, they exclaim upon the inhuman disasters of their miserable situation; but in vain; for they found no food to replenish their hungry

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 11

appetites, unless to have fed upon unknown roots which were not agreeable to their palates; yet hoping ere long to harbour themselves in some homely cottage where with rustic fare they might appease their hunger: upon the foundation of this hope they continued their journey, and at last came to the descent of a deep valley, where, with a faint courage, walking pensively through the thicket of an ancient forest, they espied the architecture of some domestic mansion, which to their sorrowful contemplations produced unexpected encouragement: resuming courage at this change of fortune, they directed their course to the outward gate, where they beheld an ancient castle, but so solitarily situated in the center of the forest, that the wind piercing through the branches of the lofty cedars, made such a mournful murmur, that the dolefulness thereof drove our

12 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.
young princes into a fit of effeminate despair; hunger so far constrained them, that they resolved to enter; and opening the outward gate, they pasted the first court without the appearance of any living creature; on entering the second, they beheld a spacious court richly paved with curious marble, which was circumferenced with a sumptuous arched gallery, propped by pillars of shining alabaster; casting their eyes a small distance, they discovered a lady, sweet and amiable, sitting under the shady leaves of a fig-tree, recreating her senses with the sweet found of a well-timed lute, to which she joined her ravishing voice.

As soon as she had ended, she began to call on her lost MEDOR, and in a sit of despair instantly fell to the ground, which the young princes perceiving, flew hastily to her assistance, and raising her from the flowery bank whereon she fell, used such preservative

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 13

means for her recovery, as their unskilful, though willing industry could afford; and in a short time, by good fortune, she again recovered. Seeing these two strangers before her, she was greatly surprised, and with anger seated on her brow, uttered these words.

“Gentlemen, for so your aspects invite me to call you; if you knew how divinely quiet I endured this deadly slumber into which I was entered, I absolutely know, or at least believe, that in equity you would have refrained from disturbing me, and permitted me to reap the benefit of my consolation; but since things past, cannot be recalled, I will, on condition you immediately depart, for this your first offence, not esteem you guilty. I have here wholly betaken myself to sorrowfulness, and have long since devoted my zeal to the shrine of disconsolation; my desire

14 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

is neither to see nor be seen, but rather to lead the pilgrimage of my life from the sight of any. This solitary place I have chosen for my habitation, and here, unless death prevent my meditations, I resolve to wait the return of a dear friend, which inconsistent fortune, for many months hath detained from me. In reality I hate the sight of any, and for his sake loath the prospect of all. Therefore, I beseech you, at the request of an
unfortunate lady, immediately to depart, that, according to my accustomed manner, I may sincerely, upon the altar of his absence, devoutly sacrifice my affectionate sighs, in token, that till death, in the garden of my maiden amity, the resemblance of his self, and idea of his perfections, shall, to my everlasting comfort, immortally flourish.”

The princes with attentive ears listened to the effect of her Speech, and making their

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 15

obeisance, Thalmeno addressed himself to her as follows:

“Madam, if our sudden arrival, has prejudiced your sorrowful devotions, or detained you from performing those vows to him, who is happier than any of his fellow creatures, in being beloved by such virtue as dwells in you, we are ready to acknowledge our defect in being so presumptuous, and express our sorrow; but since the purity of our pretense may plead for the excuse of our rudeness, and the innocency of our resolutions, crave remission for our boldness, we doubt not, but when you shall have heard our sorrowful relation, you will afford us your gracious pardon, and bury our offence in the grave of oblivion.”

“To give you an account, Madam, of our extraction; we are nobly born, the one heir apparent to the crown of Egypt, the other to the diadem of Cicilia, our

16 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

names Palmos and Thalmeno, who in the prime of our minorities resolved to travel; and having privately embarked ourselves, without leave of our royal parents, we lately arrived in the next bordering harbour; since which time, as faithless and erroneous fortune guided us, we strayed into an unknown desert, where these three days we have dangerously travelled without finding sustenance to relieve our hunger; at last, ranging this solitary forest, we fortunately arrived at this your castle; our design, Madam, is not to incur your indignation, but earnestly to implore your relief, that in paying the debt we owe to nature, we may avoid the tyrannizing empire of death, which now begins to reign over us; therefore, if your gentle pity will extend so far, we shall for ever remain servants both to your bounty and beauty; and till the period of death, hold the term of our lives as again repurchased

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 17
chafed by your goodness, and depart when it shall please you to command us.”

The lady pondering upon this deplorable speech, soon conceived in her breast a motion of relaxation, which secretly inspired her to entertain them with all agreeable curiosity; and taking them kindly by the hand, conducted them to an elegant dining- room, commanding her virgins to furnish the table with such as her solitary habitation could afford ; the young adventurers very orderly, without any prolix ceremonies, fell hungrily to their meat. —For this repast they returned their thanks, which was no sooner ended, than Thalmeno (burning with desire to know the effectual cause of this lady’s desolate retirement) with a princely grace, continued his precedent discourfe.

“Madam, if the repetition of your misfortunes renew not your grief, or the display of your sorrows increase not your

18 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

disconsolations, I should esteem it a great happiness might I obtain so much favour at your fair hands, as to inform us why you make this desert your domestical mansion; and the occasion why, with numberless sighs, you repeat the name of Medor. Indeed, Madam, so much beauty and divine perfections should rather befit a monarch’s court than a rural habitation; and a prince’s bed than a pilgrim’s cottage; but experience teaches us, that all are subject to fate, and none exempted from adversity; for as soon the prince as the peasant, the lady of honour as the poorest virgin, are, or may be crossed with Cupid’s darts, the sting of sorrow, or the tyranny of misfortune.”

The prince having ended his speech, the lady made him this answer:

“Sir, at your request, I will inform you that I have long since loved a young and
noble youth, his name I shall forbear

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 19

mentioning, by reason the motive will renew the birth of my accustomed disconsolateness; however that you may not condemn me of perverse ingratitude, I will, if you please to attend my arrival, go to my closet, and their constrain my rambling pen to set forth the secrets of my sorrows, and in effect, to discover the sole history of my misfortunes.”

Thalmeno and Palmos rejoicing at this unexpected favour, accepted of her kind offer, and having familiarly saluted each other, she immediately departed to her closet, and in a short time returned to the young princes, and delivered herself in this short speech.

“Gentle strangers, to satisfy your earnest demands, here, take this paper, wherein, though rudely, yet sincerely, I have demonstrated the cause of my retirement, and pend down the griefs that I sorrowfully endure. My present wealth is such

20 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

that I cannot afford you many gifts; yet, as a testimony of my zealous affection towards you, take this small sum of worthless gold to supply your necessities when any future occasion shall present itself. What incommodious entertainment you have met withal in this castle, I pray forget with favour, or what is wanting of respect in me, I beseech you remit with partiality; in recompense whereof, I will sacrifice my devout prayers for the establishing of your prosperity, and beseech heaven- to send you a fortunate and safe return; in hope whereof, in all honour, I take my sorrowful leave.”

Having received the paper, with tears in their eyes, they kissed her mournful cheeks, and rendering her thanks for their courteous entertainment, departed; directing their course to a neighbouring mountain, which having attained, they cast themselves on a green bank, and on opening

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 21

the letter, found these lines contained in it.

“Know, princes, my name is FLORINA, the only daughter of AGENOR, king of Numidia; attaining to the perfect age, I was fought for in marriage by many princes, both of Africa and Europe; and, as the king my father affected some for their private wealth, so others I hated for their public enormities. But, Cupid storming at my liberty, and Venus at my single estate, acknowledging that there was no life but love, nor no paradise but the pleasures of marriage, they so bent their invective ambition against my innocency, that at last, by the means of Fortune, who had likewise intruded herself in the union of their sympathy, they unexpectedly sent to my father’s court, a lovely young prince, named Medor, the son and heir of Orlando, king of Biafara; who, penetrated with the 

22 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.
flying report of my worthless psrson came to Numidia, to protest himself my
servant; upon whose beautiful aSpect I no sooner fixed my eyes, than I immediately
felt the flames of fancy sparkle within my tormented breast. On the other side, prince Medor, so often frequented our royal palace, that at last, if his protestations were unfeigned, he repoSed his bless in my beauty, and reaped his chiefest pleasure in enjoying my desired presence: in a short time, however, our affections were so firmly united, that I became the mistress of his thoughts, and he master of my imaginations.”

“But now despiteful destiny began to display part of his infidelity; our familiarity being noised throughout the court, soon reached the ears of the king, my father, who, raging at this unexpected event, resolved, to nip the blossoms of our tender affections; therefore, sending for the

the young prince, he not only checked him with thundering threats and invective speeches, but commanded him to silence, and to depart his territories immediately.”

“Notwithstanding the king, my father, had bereaved me of this my princely lover, within whose breast I reposed my happiness, he used me so cruelly, and laid such a restraint on my liberty, that I could not one minute reap repose of my imaginations, but continually lived in a most tormenting calamity: therefore, accounting courtly joys vain-glorious trifles, and a princely life a splendent misery, in a night, which seemed to allow of my resolutions, I departed the court, and betook myself to the establishing of this sorrowful life: at last, Fortune resolving to assist me in my misery, happily made me retire hither; which solitary place doth so correspond with my mournful fancy, that for the

24 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS,

ardent affection which I bear prince Medor, I firmly resolve, either here to attend his expected arrival, or else to finish my days in manifestation of my fidelity. Therefore, dear princes, attribute my disobedience to my parents as the impulse of love, bestowing on it a favourable censure, and I resolve, that what my will prescibeth, my capacity shall perform; that is, immortally to remain faithful to my lover, or everlastingly unfriendly to myself.

CHAP III.
They arrive at the palace of Folly—a dwarf appears, and prevails on them to quit the palace, which they have no sooner done, but the whole building is swallowed up.

They had no sooner perused the paper, but pitying the fate of the unhappy lady, they resolved to range the confines of Africa in search of Medor, her lost lover; that, by their friendly diligence, Florina might be delivered from her deplorable condition: by virtue of which heroic resolution, raising themselves from the verdant grass, with familiar amity, prosecuted their journey in such a manner, that after traveling a few days, they espied a verdant tent, on whose lofty turret a snow-white ensign flourished in the air; they no sooner approached this delightful object, but they perceived it to be

26 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

an eglantine bower, decked with columbines and damask roses. Being desirous to survey every part of it, they resolutely entered, where a showy beagle, with Argus eyes, vigilantly saluted them with his shrill barking notes.--A nymph being roused from her repose at this unexpected alarm, began to tear through the bower.

But Venus and Diana having metamorphosed their malice to a future sympathy, so ordained it, that her amber locks should be entangled in the eglantine briars.--The princes taking hold of her loose garments, notwithstanding her force, compelled her to stay; but the nymph, thinking them to be Apollo and Jove, who had descended from heaven to ravish her virginity on earth, bitterly cried out, and tore the tresses of her hair: which our princes perceiving, with fair speeches began to appease her aggravation, requesting her only to conduct them to some adjoining


The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 27
cottage, where, for that night, they might assuredly rest in some peaceful tranquillity. The nymph, fully satisfied, raised herself from the earth, and very freely conducted them through the woods and forests, where many troops of light-footed satyrs ran before, as triumphant heralds to proclaim their passage; at last, she brought them to a sumptuous palace, whose pyramids and towers loftily presumed to elevate their tops in the azure skies; the walls were of glittering alabaster, the gates of pure crystal, the pavement of black jet, intermixed with azured marble, the battlements of refined gold, the windows of transparent diamonds, and the roof of vermilion coral wrought with orient guards of silver; the interior lineaments owed nothing in correspondence to the outward edifice; for the portals and galleries were of white ivory, the bedsteads

steads of clarent amber, the coverlids and curtains of green damask embossed with emeralds, and the the tapestry of crimson velvet embroidered with amethysts and
pearl. In the spacious court and delicious bowers which Flora had adorned with the
treasures of her painted drapery, were likewise many curious fountains; some conveyed thither by the instinct of nature, and others erected by the ingenuity of art. Upon the borders of these fountains were growing many fruitful trees, whereon were artificially arranged divers harmonious birds. In short, there wanted no ornament to make this sumptuous palace a terrestrial paradise: it was impaled with lofty cedars, fenced draw-bridges, and impregnable bulwarks; likewise circumferenced with many curious rivers. Our two princes, with their nymphs, being arrived to this dignified place, were forthwith met by an

ancient matron, who, seeming to be the lady thereof, very kindly gave them a welcome. Her habit was of a fable hue, having her showy hair hanging down her face; her beauty seemed to be nipped by age; yet, in the lineaments of her complexion, lay furrowed the anatomy of an indifferent countenance; the arches of her sorrowful eyes were over-veiled with a crimson dye, from out of whose conduits it appeared many brinish tears had had their issue. After some conversation with her unexpected guests, perceiving the zeal of their youthful resolutions were devoted to travel, she, with a faint voice, delivered herself to the following effect:

“Courteous friends, for such I hope you are, fear not to enter this palace, but
advance with freedom ; for your eyes shall be presented with such delightful

30 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

objects as shall please your contemplations.”

Having spoken these few words, she abruptly broke off, and, as fast as she could, fled to the forests. The princes, feeing the sudden departure of this ancient lady, were much astonished ; but, at last, assuming courage, and the fable night beginning to over-cast the element with ob-obscurity, after taking leave of their nymphs, boldly entered; passing the outward gate, they were met by two beautiful virgins, who, saluting them with a smiling countenance, arm in arm, most lovingly conducted them to a stately theatre, where they beheld many amorous ladies with their gallants. After a short stay, they were conducted to a very rich bed-chamber, where several frolicsome sparks were unchastely courting their beauteous mistresses; and in such an indecent manner

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS 31.

that Vesta, nay Venus herself, could scarce have refrained from blushing, at their immoderate familiarity. Being glutted with variety of unchaste prospects, they were lighted to their chambers, where, to pass away the tediousness of the night, two lascivious ladies were profered to bear them company; but the young princes, notwithstanding this temptation, had their immoveable resolution fixed upon honour’s foundation, and not accepting of this unexpected civility, virtuously craved their absence, which was immediately complied with; when, thinking to repose themselves, they were again solicited by two blooming virgins, who, bringing their lutes in their hands, with melodious music thought to lull their premeditations asleep. Immodest smiles they had at command; their garments were both gay and loose, and in all things, fitly corresponding with their inward qualities.

32 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

But neither their deceitful melody, their venomous glances, nor their alluring
lascivious gestures could charm the genius of the princes, or enchant their generosity to range beyond the bounds of, modesty; but like two religious pilgrims, they fought against vicious concupiscence, and ardently devoted their zeal, to the shrine of virtue; not regarding their smiles, they resolutely thrust them out of their chamber, and after securing the door, they betook themselves to rest.

But Morpheus had nor long detained their spirits in delicious slumber, but having contracted his influence with the instinct of celestial deity, they were in the depth of their nocturnal sleep alarmed by a hideous clamour, which rattled in the palace with such a thundering noise, as if the whole foundation was subject to a sudden revolution; grievous groans were plenty, cries were common, and all diverted to such

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 33

such a tempestuous confused chaos, as if the atlas of the world, had, in the vivacity of his fury, summoned the confines of the earth to the dreadful day of judgment. At this the young princes instantly left their beds, when behold, there appeared to them a delectable dwarf dressed in crimson, who, with an angelical voice, desired them to depart the place, and follow the paths of virtue.

At the sight of this pretty pigmy, with advised deliberation they pondered upon the etymology of his speech, and could not, at first, refrain from being astonished. After ruminating more seriously on their situation, they resolved to follow their tender guide; and, arming their courage with magnanimity, flew thro’ the courts, directing their steps to a lofty mountain, from whence they saw this glorious palace suddenly swallowed up in the earth’s concavity, and in such a manner, that no

34 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

appearance of the foundation remained; this accident they could not at first believe, but instantly surmised that their eyes and imaginations had been deluded with invasions. The dwarf perceiving their doubtful perplexities, ran away from them, and to comfort their passions, the old forlorn lady which they first met, again presented herself to their view ; and after having lowly saluted them, mournfully uttered the following words,

“My sons, says she, my name is Virtue, who, of my own authority, invented this tragedy for your advantage; the glorious mansion which you have seen destroyed, is the temple of folly, wherein only remained the imps of luxurious iniquity; who, pampering up lustful Cytherea, were always persecutors of chaste Diana, my society they ever disdained, and contumeliously smothered my temples with the contagious incest of debauchery; amongst

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 35

which diabolical regiment, perjury was familiar, swearing no sin, pride a feast, lust a lord, ambition a saint, and treachery a goddess; but now, my sons, their immoderate pride is past, their unchaste desires extenuated, their satanical oaths drowned, their aspiring ambition evaporated, their graceless treachery abolished, all their obscure actions, together with themselves, utterly destroyed, and furiously sent to the infernal pit of everlasting perdition; therefore, beware of their subtle devices, and let the mirror of their misfortunes, serve as an instance to keep you within the circumference of piety; and
to the end, that being absent, you may still ponder and premediate upon my exhortations, take this paper, and observe such divine counsel as I have therein prescribed.”

Which having said, she in the twinkling of an eye, elevated herself in the air and

36 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

a cloud over-veiling her in his embraces, she immediately vanished.

The young princes were greatly astonished at what they had seen, and on opening the paper found the following rules contained in it:

1. Build the foundation of thy faith upon purity and piety, that thy zeal be not eclipsed with the contagion of idolatry, but rather perfumed with the sweet incense of sincerity. 
2. Let devout prayers be a mediatrix between heaven and thyself, for it is the most assured step to obtain felicity.
3. Conceal thy secrets in the closet of thy breast, lest rashly displaying them to others, thou produce the prejudice of thine own tranquillity.
4. Fly ambition, as the poison of the sense, and detest envy as the canker of thy contemplations.

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 37
5. Gaze not on beauty lest it engender repentance, but loath a lascivious courtesan as the scourge of iniquity.
6. In thy actions be faithful lest being blemished with reproach thou impair thy reputation.
7. Honour thy king as God’s anointed, and if occasion present, live and die for thy country.
8. Detest vain glory as the venom of sin, and abolish superstition as the cloak of ungodliness.

By the sound of music, they are drawn into a forest, where they find an aged father, seated in a fragrant bower.-—He informs them, at their request, why he lives that retired life.-—At their departure he gives them the necessary instructions for their journey.

Having perused the contents of the paper, and knowing the sacred influence thereof tended to the establishing of their celestial tranquility, they imprinted it in their memories, that it might serve for a fenced circumference, to retain them in the confines of piety; and triumphing that fortune had presented them with so sacred an instance, they joyfully departed.

But even Aurora the daughter of Thetis, had no sooner skipped from the towers of Neptune, and saluted the excellency of

of transplendent Phoebus, then the young princes again prepared themselves for a new journey; and early in the purpled morn, when radian Titan began to give his welcome to the verdant mountains, the fawns and nymphs dancing through the forests, and doleful Philomena warbling forth her tragedy, they were by a soft wind made acquainted with the pleasant found of a lute, the echo whereof redoubling through the thickness of a curled grove next adjoining, gave such a graceful harmony to the aforesaid melody, that they were constrained to find out the said unknown Orpheus, that he might for a while recreate their disordered sense, with the exquisiteness of his praiseworthy art.

Directing their course towards the grove, they came to the prospect of a fair valley, in the midst of which ran most leisurely a silver stream, whose banks in equal

distance were beset with fruitful lemon trees: which delightful prospect so pleased their youthful imaginations, that they immediately bent their course to the aforesaid arbor.—-On their entrance, they saw a beautiful little boy crowned with a laurel-garland seated on a flowery bank close by the river side.—-While they were listening to his youthful melody, they saw an aged father seated in a fragrant bower, who, by the furrows of his face, had in their tender years endured many calamities—his habit was of black fables—-his vissage pale and wan-—and his white beard descended almost to his middle—-in his hand he held a staff, which was the feeble supporter of his withered age.—-Being anxious to know the cause of his disconsolate retirement, they immediately went to the bower, and interrupting him from his earnest study, Palmos thus addressed himself to him.

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 41
“Venerable father, if our arrival has disturbed your study, or our presence, your patience, we beseech you to pardon the first, though a rash attempt, and excuse the latter, as being an unwilling enterprise.—-Travelers are, you well know, lovers of novelties-—therefore, aged Sir, we beg you to relate to us the occasion of this retirement, and the motive which induced you to embrace this austere life.”

The ancient father was well satisfied with this apology for the fredom they had taken, and judging, by their appearance, that they were of noble extraction, very freely, but with a gravity which seemed to embellish his speech, made them this friendly reply:

Your, arrival hath neither disturbed my study, nor your presence prejudiced my patience—for as my nature is not attractive to severity on the one fide, so, on the contrary, I make use

42 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

of the other at leisure, therefore you are both welcome; and, as a friendly demand deserveth a familiar reply, know that this bower is my retiring place, when passionate fancies begin to surround my distempered sense.—oThis boy I have instructed in music, that when my eyes dazzle with much reading, he may, with his melody, rouse my spirits from the
thoughts of slumber, and also put me in mind of the accustomed duty which I owe to the sorrowful shrine of my dead faint, which, whilst she lived, I affected more dearly than myself; and being dead, will honour with such ardent fidelity, that future ages shall acknowledge, that till death, and after, to my fair Ismena, I remained completely constant; in remembrance of whom, at the end of this grove, in a fragrant valley, I have, as duty and love prompted me, erected a tomb, whereunto, till the period of

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 43

my days, I have vowed daily to offer her my throbbing sighs, as repentant witnesses of my calamity: therefore, gentlemen, if you please to walk thither, your eyes will be made spectators of that which I have with grief and aggravation discovered to you.—-I will likewise give you such instructions for your travels, that doubtless you will find them very profitable to you, and in your adventures no way prejudicial.”

The princes returned him thanks for his civility-—and walking through ranks of lofty cedars, which, with their ver-dent branches beautified the adjoining silver stream, they arrived to the sacred chapel.-—Having viewed the tomb, they returned to find out the ancient mourner, who purposefully attending their coming, took them by the hand, and
with tears in his eyes continued his discourse

44 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

“Gentlemen, my grief is such, that I loath my life—-and were it not too offensive to my soul I could willingly be instrumental to my own untimely death-—but alas!—I know that that would be a sacrifice too abominable in the sight of heaven, which is the only rein that withholds me from executing my resolutions.”

-—Here he was interrupted by Thalmeno, who addressed himself as follows:

“Venerable Sir, the effects of amorous contemplation, should now, I think, thro’ age be purged from your memory, and the remembrance of past pleasures buried I in oblivion-—it is not for you, who are ready to salute the grave, to sacrifice sighs to Cupid—therefore, Sir, consider with yourself, that that fair excellence whom you adore, is now no more, and cannot by any mortal means be revived.’’

Delmon perceiving he was answered rather sharply, wept afresh—-however,

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 45
comforting his sorrowful muse with patience, with tears in his eyes, he requested them to enter his homely habitation, and to accept of such fare as his poverty could afford them, to which they willingly complied.—-The repast being over, and the princes ready to depart, with as much freedom as his passion would permit, gave them these following instructions:—-

“Finding your resolutions are bent on travel, I must inform you, that at the court of BRILION king of Zanfara some few leagues from hence, there are always resident men who esteem discretion a chief point of valour, and no way backward in venturing their lives for the establishing of their fame; their senators also are both grave, politic, and provident; therefore, gentlemen, if you direct your course thither, you will generally see
each live by the fertility of his own land-—each reap the fruit of his own vine—-

and content sit smiling in every, corner.—-There you may behold the fragrant fields adorned with their verdant vestures, the lofty trees with their gay garments, and the fruitful arbors with the treasure of Flora—-likewise their mountains covered with show-white flocks, their meadows with the riches of Ceres, and their valleys with the choicest flowers.-—In their parks you will find regiments of fallow deer, and on every bush, harmonious birds warbling forth their melody.”

Perceiving that Delmon had finished his speech, and transported with the report, of so flourishing a kingdom, they gave him many thanks for their kind entertainment, praised him, for his virtuous exhortations, and humbly took their leave.

After traveling through an unknown country, they at last arrived to the chiefest city of Zanfara where the court then was—and taking up their lodging at the best inn which the place afforded, they remained three days to refresh themselves of their dangerous travels and fatigues.—Recollecting they were now in a kingdom far from their native home, and that it was necessary to settle their proceedings upon the main of some

resolution to avoid future misfortunes, they determined to set apart all delays, and offer their service to the king, justifying themselves to be knights of Arabia; and changing their names from Thalmeno to Thalmo, and from Palmos to Plivio, they dispatched a letter to the king, which was no sooner received, but he commanded the two foreign knights to be
brought to his presence, and after receiving them in a manner suitable to his dignity, courteously accepted of their voluntary service.---During their stay at this court, their gallant actions, courteous behavior, and princely wisdom, conquered the affections, not only of the king, but of the nobility and gentry likewise.—-The king, as a token of his esteem, appointed Thalmo preceptor to the princess ATHELIA, his daughter, and Plivio governor of Ithica castle, where the princess MERSiLA, daughter to SAMOR

Thalmo goes to the forest and unexpectedly meets with Athelia,— He determines to discover his passion. The lady treats him with great contempt, and departs abruptly.

Early in the morn  before the pearled dew was exhaled by the shining rays of golden Phoebus, when the fragrant flowers were displaying the pride of their beauty, and the melodious birds on the swelling bushes, warbling forth their melody, it chanced that Thalmo, captivated with the beauty of Athelia, betook himself to the fields, not only to refresh his tormented mind, but to make the flowery meadows acquainted with his amorous
fancies.—-

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 51
Directing his course to the verdant forests, he came to a spacious grove, whose branches expelling the darts of Titan, made a beautiful shade for retired passengers.—This retirement corresponding with his desires, he cast himself on a bank of flowers; and, having vented his passions, and made the forests echo with his malady, he resolved to return.—At his departure, fortune so ordained it, that the princess Athelia with her attendant ladies, were coming to the grove.—-Pleased with this unexpected sight, and elevating his resolutions upon the wing of honour, he resolved to present her with the idea of his affection—-and finding her sequestered
from her attendants (within a myrtle bower) after the ceremonies due to her royal birth, he thus addressed himself to her.

52 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS “ Madam,

“Madam, When, by the aid of Fortune, I saw so much beauty, I immediately felt my tender breast inspired with a lover’s paSsion; and to such a degree, that ever since, I have firmly sworn my fidelity to the service of your superior excellence—-at the appearance of so many charms, my senses are so much captivated, that all I am now capable of, is to admire you.-—My birth is such, that, if known to you, might plead much in my behalf—therefore, dear madam, if my sighs might disclose, my tears explain, or my passions discover what a zealous flame my heart possesses in your favour, I think you would not only recompense my desert, but also repay my fidelity with your affection; and here I determine, till the period of my pilgrimage,

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 53

to remain as constant to the princess Athelia, as I with she should be affable to the perplexed Thalmo.”

The princess, (being unacquainted with such amorous encounters sharply returned him this answer.

“Why Thalmo, said she, hath my kindness made thee so arrogant, or my underserving favour so presumptuous, that thou shouldst discourse to me of love —-hath my affability emboldened thee to aspire so high, as to declare thy affection to one so much thy superior? Hath idleness in my service, taught thee to adorn thy tongue with flattery ?—-And is there no other object for thee to aim at but me?-—As for thy birth, I disdain it as nothing, and thyself as less:—-if thou hast sacrificed sighs, or shed tears for my sake,

54 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

why do you expect a recompense where there is no satisfaction to be made?—To be brief, refrain from prosecuting thy folly, or I will use such means that the king, my father, shall be made acquainted with your presumption.”

This decisive answer might doubtless have made a soldier retire for fear—-but
Thalmo, disdaining to quit the siege for the first repulse, earnestly continued his discourse.

“If you conjecture, Madam, that in discovering my affections, I flatter your merits with a show of derision, you greatly wrong my honour—therefore, dear Ma<dam, for my faithful affection, do not term me an ungrateful servant; if my affections were predestinated for yourself alone, disdain not him, Madam, which in

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 55

in heart, hath long since vowed to adore you, and to whom he dedicates his whole devotions, and reward not that passion with scorn, whose firmness you cannot doubt.”

“Thalmo, replied the princess, if thy affection were equal to the tenor of thy words, I think you should at my request, bury the repetition thereof in the grave of silence, and not be guilty of so great a presumption.-—My resolution can never be diverted from reaping the enjoyment of a single life ; therefore, since my mind cannot be subject to servile love, let my commands be a mediatrix to cause thee to bid a final adieu to thy
peevish enterprise.”

The princess was going to depart, but Thalmo continuing his discourse, she seated

56 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

seated herself again: “ Madam, said he, if my words could decipher my passion, or my tongue express my affection, I should think myself most happy; though now I esteem myself of all men the most unfortunate.—-Unfortunate I may well fay, that my fidelity should be obscured in the midst of incredulity; which if you would but sincerely weigh in the balance of reason, I assure myself, my constancy would remove the residence of your mistrust, and inform you, that my ardent flame, (which none but yourself can extinguish) springs from true felicity. That harsh determination of living a recluse life, I beseech
you to recall; for the possessing your presence, and the obtaining of your commands would yield me the satisfaction of my trembling desires-—my merit, perhaps, may in time acquire more favour from your princely goodness, as I am resolved to

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 57
to live and die in your service, and to attend on your person with such fidelity, affection, and submissive loyalty, that your fair self with your royal father, shall one
day bless the hour of my arrival.

The princess well noting with what fervency he vented his passion, began to show some motion of compassion; but that he should not conceive any spark of hope, where there was no performance meant to be effected, made him this sharp reply:

“Thalmo, your obstinate opinion will constrain me hereafter to loath thy company, it is now high time to put a period to this conference, because the tediousness of it tires my senses in understanding it. What I have said I mean to perform, and leave you to your passionate folly; as your

58 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

request is to continue in my service, I cheerfully comply, provided your desires
aspire not to my prejudice.-—Consider with yourself what the king, my father,
will say, when he hears of your presumption.-—Therefore, Thalmo, take my advice, think better of what you have said, recall your follies, and be penitent for your offence.” Perceiving that the princess had finished her cruel oration, he immediately said to her;

“Is it possible, madam, that so much beauty and cruelty can dwell together? and is it possible, that each being the other’s enemy, they should both seek my ruin:-—Consider, princess, the purity of my pretense, and the desire of my expectation! and think, that if Thalmo lives, he must love the fair Athelia:—- Dear madam, distill into your heart the
gentle 

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 59

drops of pity, and amidst the showers-of your anger, let the resplendent fun of favour evaporate your wrath! let the dew of patience soften your cruelty, that I may, at last, reap that happiness I have so long desired.”

“Thalmo,” said the princess, “I see that thou art a servant to folly; and, it is in vain to dissuade, where senseless absurdity doth command.-—I am sorry that I have remained with you so long, as thou art blinded with a frivolous humour, that springeth rather from a fond understanding, than from a tormented spirit.”

The princess, to conceal her passion, immediately departed; and directed her steps towards the court, where we shall leave her for a while with her royal parents.

Thalmo is enraged at Athelia’s abrupt departure. He resolves to write to her.—-The princess determines to correspond with Thalmo, and acknowledges her love for him alone.

Thalmo feeing the princess depart so unexpectedly, changed his pleasant countenance to a pale complexion ; continually crying out upon cruel, destiny, and often sighing as-if his heart would break; falling from sighs to tears, and then from tears to sigh again; then calling on Athelia, as if that name had I ravished his senses with divine cogitations;
at length, he retired to his closet, and resolved to write to her; that he might in
some measure ease his tormented mind.

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 61

As soon as he had finished his epistle, he hasted to a lady of the princess Athelia, and requested her to deliver it to the princess, to which she readily consented and finding her alone in her chamber, with an humble reverence, effected her promise. The princess, at first, was unwilling to receive it, not knowing from whence it came; however, she took the letter, which she had no sooner opened than she saw the name of Thalmo, and commanding her woman to depart, she locked her chamber door, and read the contents: this brought to her remembrance the doleful sighs, and passionate agonies, which, as messengers of faithful constancy, he sent to witness the miseries he endured: she forgot not the proud repulses, sharp answers, bitter threats, and obstinate denials that she gave his enter-prize; which, when considered, made her burn

with anger. Indeed, she confessed (relinquishing obstinate coyness) her passion was then magnanimous for Thalmo, although modesty would not permit her to discover it; and that she adored him, as the sacred image to whom she paid her devotions. “Thalmo,” said she “and none but him, shall live in my remembrance, and none but him alone can boast of such a conquest: though pride at first seemed to reign in my breast, when I refused his precepts, I will now be as affable; in accepting his affection; though then pertinacious in denying his requests, yet now as willing to agree to his petitions; and though then refractory in not being attentive to his desires, yet now as tractable to his demands;—-but, whether Athelia, dost thou wander? what lunatic folly doth possess thy Senses? or whither runs thy wits a wandering without their guide,

discretion? Hath an amorous passion so soon transported thy mind with fancies, or lovely toys so instantly obscured thy reason, with absurdity, that without regard to modesty, thou proclaims thy simplicity;—is she who was so long courted, now become an oratory suitor? and must she plead to him for love, who petitioned her for affection?—Such, Athelia, is thy fate; and therefore contradict not that which the gods have already decreed; satisfy thyself with what is contingent to thee, and hereafter seek, by some favourable means, to correspond with thy beloved Thalmo, to the end, that his presence may expel those mists of sorrow, that now intoxicate thy senses.”

The queen, her mother, wondering at her long absence from the court, ordered Levina, her woman, to find her out;

64 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

out; who, knowing where she left the princess, went directly to her chamber, and acquainted her that the queen desired her presence at the palace.—Athelia, perceiving the time had deceived her, and clearing up her countenance the best she could, failed not, according to her duty, to hasten to the queen, where, contrary to her expectations, she received this severe check.

“Athelia, said the queen, hath too much freedom made you forget yourself ? or has some extraordinary affair retained you so long from our presence? was you with your tutors, lady Florina, or whence came you.”

“May it please your majesty,” replied the princess, “I have long since been invited to see the lady Fulvia’s chamber, and

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 65

and this morning unexpectedly she came for me; your majesty being in your closet, I was unwilling to disturb you; therefore I departed without taking my leave; my lady Florina was then at her devotions, and only Issida, my maid, attended me.”

With this reply the queen was satisfied; and leaving Athelia in her presence, we will return to the perplexed Thalmo.—Having received no answer to the letter he sent by Levina, such rage possessed his senses, and such anger overpowered his reason, that he was quite bereaved of his understanding; all company he abandoned, and detested the light; his laughter was metamorphosed to tears, and nothing could enter his imagination, but the image of Athelia; his chamber seemed tiresome, and his bed uneasy; his

torments might be compared to the tortures of Ixion, only with this exception, that he had a fairer deity in Athelia, than Ixion had in Proserpina; when he waked the image of Athelia stood before him, whose beauty he adored, as the only comfort of his heart’s content. When in his study, pensively passionate, he would suddenly arise, and ask, who was there? as if the princess had been knocking at the door: at other times he would direct his course towards the fields, and there, to the senseless trees, decipher forth the manner of her cruelty; and from the fields to his melancholy habitation, where we will leave him to the fancy of his affections, and return to the almost-forgotten Plivio.

Plivio having been appointed by the king deputy-governor of Ithica castle, where Mersilva was kept prisoner, could not brook the treatment which that princess received from PORUS, the governor. The king allowed her a decent chamber, pleasant walks, a table answerable to her person, and a woman to attend her; on the contrary, Porus abridged her of these privileges, and placed her in an obscure dungeon, where the thoughts of so detestable a place might have

hurried the greatest hero into a labyrinth of despair. Instead of pleasant walks, she had only the liberty of her close prison; her diet was homely, and scarce enough to assist nature; and instead of an attendant woman, was served by an ugly ruffian, within the furrows of whose angry brow, envious wrath sat triumphant; having, from his governor, a strict order to hinder all those that, in compassion to her distress, should attempt to give her relief.

Mersilva, perceiving her hard usage, exclaimed on Fortune, lamenting that ever she had attained so dismal an aspect.—Weep she might, for there were no spectators of her lamentation; and well might she lament, and cast forth sighs, for there was none to comfort her in the depth of her miseries.—If at any time she

The ROYAL ADVENTURES. 69

bemoaned herself; to her rigorous keeper, with forcible arguments to induce him to pity, she was immediately checked with a catalogue of reproaches; alleging, that her entertainment exceeded her merits; which, as a second wound, transported her reason so far, that with wringing hands and throbbing sighs, she to herself made the following lamentation.

“Mersilva, thou hast just occasion to acknowledge how inconsistent fortune hath been to thee; thy delights are changed to melancholy contemplations, thy pleasantness reversed to mourning, and all thy former pleasures metamorphosed to solitude. Certain it is, that glory fades as well as flourishes, beauty dies as well as insults, and honour withers as the flowers of the field, which no sooner spring forth with Titan, but die with Cynthia.

What then is the world but a labyrinth of perplexities? What then is dignity, but the seat of ambition? And what is glory but the throne of grandeur? Therefore, account thy miseries as a recompense predestinated for thy fortune; thy torments, as a reward for thy sin; and lastly; think thy calamities as a meritorious affliction projected for thy ill conduct.”

She uttered these words with such a zealous fervency, that the report thereof
would have caused disdain herself to have pitied her. The Sound of Her complaints reached the ears of Plivio, and knowing her to be a princess royally descended, and, committed without being guilty of any crime against the crown or kingdom of Zanfara, quite overcame with compassion, he cried out, “Can humanity suffer so beautiful a princess as Mersilva to endure

imprisonment, and I enjoy my liberty? Or can the dignity of that divine sex, obtain no more favour at thy hands where thou canst afford relief? Are thy senses so clouded with obscurity, thy eyes so darkened with impiety, or thy heart so loaded with cruelty, that her tears cannot solicit to thee for her freedom; or her complaints, as advocates for innocency; plead to thee for her speedy enlargement. How will the world blame you for such ingratitude, thy conscience accuse thee of rigor, and thy thoughts condemn thee of tyranny, when the fact shall appear at the judgment seat of reason, where thy
faults are descried, and thy folly disclosed? What argument wilt thou allege for thy excuse? Or what mark of sensibility canst thou produce to overveil thy inhumamnity? Only seriously consider with thyself from whence thou art extracted; if from the

7a2The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

loins of a woman, how comes it so pass that thou art so cruel in thy nature.—Plivio, recall thy senses to the throne of pity; therefore resolve to relieve the distressed, and remember that it is worthy commendation. What, though the governor be cruel, must thou follow his example? Let not thy cruelty obscure thy liberality, nor perverse impiety overwhelm thy affability; but rather let thy actions savor of friendship, and thy resolutions be gratified with generosity; in so doing the gods will esteem it an act of justice, and all mankind a glorious compassion to so much virtue.”

Upon the ground of these resolutions, he resolved at all events to visit the princess; whereupon he hasted to her dungeon, and had no Sooner entered, but he beheld her sitting on her bed of misery.—At

the sight of Plivio she raised herself I from her feat of sorrow, and throwing aside her scarf, he discover a perfect copy of transcendent beauty, whose radiant eyes displayed their splendent influence, like fixed stars divinely seated in the celestial elements: approaching nearer to her with an humble reverence, he addressed himself to her in these words.

“Madam, I am come to crave pardon for my neglect of duty, in deferring so long that consolation I might have administered to you, during your long and unmerited confinement in this dismal dungeon; but, fair princess, impute it not wholly to my want of compassion, for the governor’s commands was the main obstacle that kept me from prosecuting my

74 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.
intentions; these objections being now removed by his departure to the court, fortune has given me this opportunity of waiting on you, and of offering to you all the civilities which this castle, or my interest can afford; therefore, Madam, if you choose to recreate yourself in the garden walks adjoining, I will with pleasure attend you, and secure your person from harm and violence.”

The princess Mersilva wondering at this unexpected kindness, dying her crystal cheeks with a vermillion blush, courteously returned him this short but grateful answer.

“Sir, My vanquished hope, which hath been transported to the very brink of

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 75

despair, being now by your unexpected goodness inspired with consolation, doth for this your kind relief, render you many thanks; and since you are pleased to afford me such happiness, I should be very ungrateful to you, and much wanting to myself, did not I accept of fs great a freedom as to enjoy the air of the fragrant fields.”

Plivio, rejoiced at her condescension, and perceiving her inclination to go, took her by the hand, and conducted her thro’ the castle, and from thence to the gardens; where they ranged from bank to bank, and from fountain to fountain; whose walls of shining marble, gave such grace to Mersilva’s eyes, that her spirits, at so pleafant a prospect, received the long looked for motion of delightful contentment. On the tops of these fountains stood

76 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

stood two female images, curiously painted, representing Minerva and Diana, each holding in their hands a little vane, and supporting the third grace crowned with an Olympian garland.—

Whilst Mersilva, was viewing these delightful gardens, Plivio ordered a banquet to be prepared, to which he invited the princess and spared no pains to make the entertainment agreeable to his royal captive. In this manner for a while, they deluded the time; and Plivio never failed to cast his eyes on the object of his wishes, which Cupid observing, immediately bent his bow, and let fly an arrow headed with desire and feathered with affection, which had such an effect on him, that he fainted at the stroke, so that he acknowledged no goddess but Cytherea, no faint but Venus, nor no lord but love; after

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 77

conducting Mersilva to the castle, he hasted to his own apartment, and passedthe rest of the day in amorous contemplations.

What, Plivio ! (said he) art thou at last vanquished in the field of beauty! or hath Cupid such influence at the first approach to penetrate thy breast with affection  Can thy resolutions which were devoted to Bellona now stoop to Venus? and though to thy prejudice devote thyself a sacrifice to love’s altar? Beware Plivio! the Syrens have sweet voices, yet are deceitful, the Panthers fair skins, yet infectious, and the Amazons beautiful faces, yet are mere dissemblers.—Though Helen was fair, she was petulant; Thais was lovely, but lewd; and Semiramis, though curious, was a courtesan:
but alas! one example makes not a maxim,

78 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.
nor doth fore-past crimes include general actions: for speak without partiality, and thy conscience will tell thee, that as there hath been a wanton Helen, so there was a wife Calliope; a lewd Thais, so a chaste Lucretia ; a vicious Semiramis, yet a virtuous Susanna; therefore, retire not with pusillanimity, but advance with fortitude, for, as the poet says,

A faint heart never pluck’d fruit from the tree of love.

Consider with thyself what Mersilva is, by descent a princess, of qualities a queen, of beauty an angel, and of perfection the phoenix of her sex. Who then but could esteem such a virgin ? Who then but could love such a matchless paragon? Nay, who but would sacrifice his life in behalf of such a saint.””

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 79 

After these amorous contemplations, he remained so restless that no object could please him but the idea of the fair Mersilva; no thought could content him unless sprung from her virtue; nor no imagination delight him, unless derived from her perfections; and burning with desire to display his passion, at length, with a trembling resolution, he wrote the following letter; which, by a trusty messenger, he sent to the fair Mersilva.

Madam,

“The passion which I have discovered in my breast is so great, that none but your gracious self is able to appease: having fixed my eyes on your beauty, I am bent to direct my devotions on the altar of your flourishing charms; since I repose the first fruits of my inclinations on the

80 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS,
	
the idea of your divine perfections, I hope a favourable answer will be the reward of my constant fidelity,

Plivio.”

Mersilva received the letter, and guessing from whence it came, opened it with a blushing countenance; which having read, she fetched a deep sigh, and found her senses surrounded with many agreeable notions of Plivio’s perfections; every line seemed to make a smooth path for Cupid’s entrance; however, after a little reflection, (considering the favours
he had before shown her) she resolved to send him an answer,

Sir,
“I received yours without much dish difficulty, thinking only to hear of your

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 81

welfare; and contrary to my expectation, find it full of amorous fancy; considering the former favours received from you, I thought it agreeable to return an answer; the purport whereof is to request, that you bid a solemn adieu to your enterprise, for the thought of affection cannot harbour in my breast; therefore, forbear to trouble me any more on the subject; and cease your solicitations to her, who intends not to be won by any:—-not omitting thanks for your kind indulgence, I remain your friend,
MERSILVA.”

Having finished her letter, she was doubtful whether she shouldaSend it, lest it might redound to the prejudice of her fame; however, founding the depth of her affection, by the mutability of her fancies,

82 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.
	
and the foundation of her love by the allurement of her liking, she resolved to pursue her purpose; in consequence of which resolution, she delivered it to a messenger, that it might be conveyed to Plivio; who, sing his utmost diligence, soon arrived at the castle, where he then resided, and being conducted to his presence, delivered him the answer to his letter.

The prince, not knowing from whence it came, broke the seal, and directing his eyes to the bottom, found the name of Mersilva:  whether his thoughts were then obscured by divine inspiration, or his breast replenished with ravishing contemplation, I refer to those who have been in the like situation. However, he read the letter, and not finding it agreeable to his inclinations, he stormed and raged as if his brains

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 83 

had been besotted with a lunatic frenzy. The messenger was all the while a spectator of his passions, and thinking it proceeded from the letter, went immediately to the princess, and informed her of the melancholy humour of his perplexed calamity.

The princess no sooner heard the condition of her lover, but she expressed great uneasiness; being angry with herself that she had occasioned so much aggravation she therefore separated herself from all company, and betook her to her closet; where she was no sooner entered, but Athelia came to visit and pass the night with her. Mersilva smothered her sorrows as well as she could, and putting on a cheerful countenance, entertained her with great familiarity and friendly

84 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

conference. Supper being ended, they betook themselves to their bed; where both, but especially Mersilva, slept with watchful countenance. But Aurora, the joyful messenger of Phoebus, had no sooner conquered the vestal night, and given the fable clouds an overthrow, than Mersilva arose, leaving Athelia in bed;—directing her course towards the fields, she came to a lofty mountain, and finding that the spring presented her with a delicious umbrage, she laid her down on the verdant grass: casting her eyes round, she saw Plivio making towards the bank whereon she sat, and immediately prepared to receive him: being arrived at the happy spot, though affection had a long time silenced his tongue, with a trembling voice he thus addressed himself to her;

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 85

“Madam, my eyes no sooner reflected on your divine beauty, but my heart was made your captive; and those troublesome lines which you received, were but messengers of my mind, and an earnest of my entire affections: I am now come to present you with the original, and to inform you, madam, that my passion is of such extent, as none but that beauty which created it can give it limits: therefore, I beseech you, decline not my affection, but let me enjoy your favours, that I may bid despair farewell.”

Mersilva replied,  It is proper time to put an end to this conversation, since the theme whereon you descant proceeds

86 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

from folly; for if you imagine that my thoughts will condescend to love’s embraces, you deceive your hopes with a vain absurdity: what I outwardly speak, proclaims my secret intentions; therefore bury your speeches in the grave of silence, and presume not to present her with your love, that can make you no return.”

Plivio, greatly perplexed, was framing an answer but Mersilva perceiving by his countenance the purport of it, suddenly departed: therefore, leaving him to his perplexities, and the lady to her passions, we shall for a while silence their proceedings, and return to prince Medor.

CHAP. IX.
The king refuses to match his daughter to Medor.—Florina is sent from court.— Medor resolves to travel.—In his passage is forced by a storm into a port in Africa; where he takes up his residence—Resolves to visit the court of Zanfara.—In his journey he finds a solitary habitation where he takes up his residence, and disguises himself like an hermit.

Medor, as you have before heard, having acquired the love of the princess Florina, and grounded his affections in her memory, was frustrated in the consummation of his bliss by Agenor, her father, who positively denied to march his daughter with him, on account of an ancient antipathy between the prince’s

88 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

father and himself. Perceiving he could not obtain his desire, nor so much as confer with the princess, as her father had commanded her to retire into the country, he resolved to travel, hoping that the influence of time would erase out the kings indignation; and therefore determined to take a voyage to the isle of Madagascar, to pay his duty, and offer his service, to his uncle, the duke of Alphonso: before he departed, lest Florina might think him guilty of ingratitude, he sent her the following letter:

“Madam,
“Destiny having resolved to metamorphosed our pleasures into psinveness, hath doubtless instigated your royal father to exercize his invective malice against our innocency; therefore, I am forced to depart,

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 89

and to leave behind me that transcendent pledge of my affection; live I cannot but in torment, being deprived of the sight of you.—But, Madam, in what desolate place forever I find a residence, my contemplations shall dwell upon the idea of your beauty, and my
mind ruminate upon your divine perfections; therefore, be not dismayed, for the gods who have made this decree, may in time revoke their sentence.— Committing you to the power of the divine protection, I remain your constant servant
MEDOR.

This letter he delivered to an intimate friend to convey to the princess, and without waiting for an answer, finding a ship ready, he embarked for Madagascar. In the passage they were overtaken by

90 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

by a storm, which continued a long time, and at last forced them into a port in Africa; where gaining the shore, and finding himself much disordered from the fatigues he had undergone, he resolved to make his abode there. After a long stay in these parts, he determined to visit the court of Zanfara; and in his journey thither, some few leagues from the court, he strayed into a forest, and found therein a solitary cottage, whose situation corresponding with his disturbed passions, he resolved to take up his habitation there; the better to cloud his secrets from the sight of the neighbouring spectators, he disguised himself in the habit of an hermit; where, forgetting his former dignity, and solacing himself with the remembrance of his long-lost Florina, he lived as a man who had forsaken all the alluring jollities of, this inconstant world,

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 91

world, and devoted his soul to the only enjoyment of celestial felicities.—Therefore, leaving him to be relieved by patience, we will return to Thalmo and the fair Athelia,

92 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.
C H A P. X.
Thalmo sues in vain to gain the affections of Athelia.—He receives a challenge from Albion, a Zanfarian prince, and promises to meet him.—Instead of meeting with the challenger, he is beset by a gang of ruffians placed there on purpose to destroy him,—But is timely relieved by Plivio.

Thalmo finding that the fair Athelia always devoted to cruelty, and concluding within himself, that she triumphed over his misfortunes, seeing her in the next arbor, after a small compliment, he addressed himself to her in these few words:

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 9,

“Madam,
It is my misfortune to love unpitied, charmed with that excellent beauty which you posses, I am come to learn whether I shall be happy or miserable.”

Athelia surprised to find Thalmo near her when she least expected him, yet shadowing her affection under the protection of nicety, sharply replied,

“Thalmo, I still am what I professed; —and if you approve of it, as you came unlocked for, so when you please you may depart.”

“Why, Madam, replied the prince, so harsh a sentence? Should I, who have been ever faithful to you, now become inconstant?

94 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

Or would you advise me to transform my fore-past affection into future hatred?”

“Thy hatred, said Athelia, doth more please me than thy affection; and yet I care little for both, and less for thyself; therefore, I desire to hear no more on the subject.”

Thalmo was ready to answer her, when the unexpected appearance of Levina, her gentlewoman, put an end to the discourse.—The princess told him his absence would be necessary, when with a low bow he humbly took his leave, raging against cupid for predestinating him to serve so tyrannizing a beauty.

Walking apart in a private place, he saw the fair Athelia direct her steps towards

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 95

the court; upon which he immediately posted thither, where he no sooner arrived, than he received the following challenge.

ALBION to THALMO.
Sir,
“Being timely acquainted with your aspiring affections for the princess Athelia, whom the world knows none can claim to so high a favour as myself, I have sent you this defiance, to meet me singly under the castle wall after dinner, there to dispute my right with thy sword, where I will severely chastise thy insolence in crossing my affections, and make thee sensible that thou hast insulted thy superior.

ALBION.



96 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

Thalmo was greatly surprised at this unexpected challenge, and disdaining to be outdone by a Zanfarian prince, by his own page returned him the following answer

“S I R,
“Understanding by the letter I have just received, that for the duty I pay to the princess Athelia, you have undertaken to correct me for that which you yourself cannot avoid; I must inform you, sir, my nature is such, that I desire to live no longer, when once deprived the sight of the fair yet cruel Athelia; at the time and place appointed, my sword shall demonstrate that my affection is such, that I will live and die in her service; and that neither thy valour, nor

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 97

the fear of death, shall tear her idea from my memory,

THALMO.”

As soon as the messenger was dispatched, he hasted to his apartment, in order to prepare for the reception of this unexpected rival:——the time being come, Thalmo, according to his promise, failed not to present himself, where, instead of meeting his challenger, he was treacherously encountered by a desperate gang of ruffians, placed in ambuscade to murder him.—Seeing them approach, he immediately put himself in a posture of defense to receive their fury; and dealt such blows among them, that at first they were forced to retreat: after reassuming their strength, they attacked him a second time, and Thalmo, not able to withstand their

98 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

united power, was glad to take the castle wall for his defense.—In short, being overpowered with this unequal force, he received several dangerous wounds, and finding his body weak by the great loss of blood, he fell to-the ground, gasping, as he thought, his last; and in memory of his dear Athelia, in broken accents, uttered these words :— “Let my blood testify how well I loved Athelia, and remained constant, even to the last.”

He had no sooner uttered these words, than Plivio came unexpectedly to his assistance—and raising him on his feet, flew to his adversaries, and made such havoc amongst them, that in a short time he remained the conqueror, and preserved a life that he loved more dearly than his own.—Having bound up his cousin’s wounds, he instantly conveyed
him 

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 99

to a skillful surgeon; and on being informed that there was none mortal, he posted to the court, to inform the princess Athelia of what had happened.

100 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

CHAP. XI.
Plivio acquaints Athelia of Thalmo’s misfortune.—At this dreadful news the princess avows her love for him.—She fends to Thalmo by his cousin—and afterwards visits him at his apartments.

PLIVIO was no sooner arrived at the palace than he hasted to the princess’s apartments; and with great concern related to her the dangers that Thalmo had undergone, and his present, unhappy situation.—Athelia, could now no longer conceal her passion, and continued weeping for his misery, being sensible that the love he bore her, had
induced him to so hazardous an enterprise.—

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 101

However, she resolved, by his friend Plivio, to fend him a few lines, as a manifestation of her affection, which were to this effect:

“Dear Prince,
“Thy misfortunes have obliged me to put pen to paper; and so overwhelmed my senses with grief, that there is not a word herein contained, but hath been washed with a tear; therefore, as Athelia is the original cause of thy misfortunes, I will, to the utmost of my power, recompense thy constant love; recommending my sorrows to your favourable censure, I remain for ever your’s,
ATHELIA.”


Thalmo soon received the letter from Plivio, and found, by experience,


102 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

that the distemper of the mind, far exceeds that of the body; for it wrought such miracles upon his cure, that, in a few days, he was perfectly recovered; and contemplating upon the favourable epistle his dear Athelia had sent him, he returned her this answer:

“Madam
“The honour you were pleased to bestow on your unworthy servant, has wrought such wonders upon my distemper, that no physician but yourself could have effected ; the virtue thereof, being so well applied, that the powerful charm has had its full operation: therefore, madam, on the idea of your divine perfections, I will for ever six my memory; never forgetting my kind persever, but continually offer up my thanks for the receipt of so great a blessing, and unfeignedly

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 103

remain, your’s, now and for ever,
THAMLO.”

The princess was much pleased with the news of Thalmo’s recovery, yet could not be satisfied with the copy, without seeing the original;—and finding an opportunity when the king and queen were absent, taking Levina with her, she went to the lodge where Thalmo resided; and being conducted to his apartment, she beheld him walking alone, with his arm bound up in a handkerchief. —At the sight of Athelia he was transported beyond measure, and forthwith embraced her, and kissed her hands:— their eyes attracted each other’s sight, and like ambassadors of love, they Seemed to ratify a mutual alliance.

104 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.
/
Thalmo, said the princess, you may well wonder at my unexpected arrival, and yet you may imagine that the news of your misfortune brought me hither;——. however, not to keep you any longer in suspense, I am now come, in some measure, to retaliate your affection, though, before I thought it not convenient to take it so soon in consideration  but since the gods have so decreed it, there is no resisting the divine powers; therefore, you may
place your happiness where your kind stars direct you.”

The prince perceived, by the fervency of her words, that she uttered no more than love induced her; and taking her by the hand, returned her this obliging answer:

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 105

“Madam,
“Your words have so much divinity in themselves, that they carry power with them to whom they are directed, and are a high cordial to afflicted spirits; the operation hath caused my breast to triumph over my sickness, which, I believed, would not only have conquered my mind, but also cut off the thread of my life.—But whither wander my sense, that I forget myself so much, as not to gratify your love with reciprocal affection?—but pardon me, dear madam, and attribute the defects of my reason to the distemper of my weakness;—for I resolve, both now and ever, to honour and adore you as the eternal goddess of my prosperity; and esteem you as the sacred image of my felicity.”

106 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

To which Athelia answered, “Where there is no offence committed, of consequence the excuse ceaseth :—thy actions being cleared from imputation, be not timoronu, for thy pardon is sealed;—therefore advance in love;—proceed in amity, and I will correspond in friendship:—for, the approbation of which, here, take my heart and hand, as the stedfast seal of immortal constancy; vowing before the imperial throne of heaven to take only Thalmo for my lord and husband
.
With, amorous ceremonies they firmly contracted themselves;—and in fsch an affectionate manner, that neither the frowns of fortune, the treachery of time, or the flattery of insinuation, could check their friendship, or once daunt their immoveable fidelity. Having now brought this

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 107

this couple to a sacred union, we will for a while leave them, and discourse of
the strange accidents that befell the princess Florina.



108 THE ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

CHAP. XII.
Florina is ordered to the court by her father —She refuses to comply.—He sends a guard
to force her, and she escapes to the seaside, where she is protected by an aged fisherman.—They are taken prisoners by a Turkish Xebeque.—Florina is detained, and the rest set at liberty.

Florina, after a long banishment, was by the king her father, commanded to repair immediately to the court;—and being apprehensive it would hinder her from paying that respect due
to the prince her lover, she positively refused to comply.—The king being in-formed of her obstinacy, immediately dispatched a messenger to force her to a

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 109

compliance;—of this she was timely acquainted, and consulted with herself how to avoid her father’s indignation.—Finding, after mature deliberation, no other means for escape, but to shelter herself under some peasant’s cottage, she laid aside her grandeur, and pursued her intended purpose.—In this situation she remained a considerable time, and as well contented as a lady of her birth and fortune could contain herself, oppressed with love.

Florina being invited to see the shepherds lead their flocks to the fragrant fields, in the close of the evening, when the golden fun was declining, as she was returning home in company with a shepardess, they were unexpectedly met by a swain, who brought the following message to Florina.

110 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS;

“Madam,
“I am sent on purpose to beg that you instantly hide yourself in some secret grove;—their is just arrived at my father’s cottage, four or five ruffians in search of you, who have desperately wounded my father for concealing you;—-if you value your own preservation, make no delay; and since the laws of nature and humanity I oblige us to assist all in distress, I will, if you think proper, conduct you with safety through the woods, where you may remain with most assured privacy,

Florina, surprised at her father’s cruelty, yet pleased with the shepherd’s civility, and pondering with herself what course to take in this exigency, at last determined to take the youth’s advice.—The shepherdess

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 111

resolving to bear her company, they directed their course to the sea side, which in two days they attained without interruption.

Walking upon the borders of the sea, they came to a little creek, where they saw an aged fisherman repairing his nets.—Having given him the time of the day, they asked him, if for recreation, he would take them a league on the ocean:—the fisherman demanded a recompense, to which they willingly complied, and with a pleasant breeze they put to sea.

In this manner they passed away the time till night gave them a summons to
return.—However, before they reached the shore, Florina informed the old man
of her deplorable situation; and likewise begged of him, with tears in her eyes, to lend

112 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

lend her his assistance in her great distress; and for her safery to convey her every day
on the sea.—The fisherman moved to compassion by her outward sorrow, and instigated by her liberality, condescended to her reasonable request.

This course they continued many days, with as much satisfaction to Florina as if she had been triumphing in her former dignity.—At last, fortune resolved to add more misery to her affliction, and caused her unexpectedly to fall within the labyrinth of a greater misfortune.

Sailing with a pleasant gale about two leagues from the shore, they were brought to by a Turkish Xebeque, who sired a gun as a signal for that purpose, and hoisting their fails, immediately bore down upon them. As soon they came along side


The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 113

they were commanded to come on board, which greatly alarmed their little crew, especially Florina, from whose eyes the round drops rolled down her beauteous cheeks; which, as the perfect messengers of sorrow, apparently demonstrated her insupportable grief;—but alas!—all in vain—for there was no remedy, nor any near at hand to rescue her from their cruelty.—Florina being the last that entered, the Turkish staves no sooner beheld her angelic beauty, than they clapped their hands, and threw their caps in the air, being overjoyed that they had got so glorious a prize to present to their sultan.

The captain of the ship admiring the beauty of Florina, by her modest aspect, conceived she was a person of noble extraction; therefore he discharged therest, and retained her only, whom he commanded

114 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

to be entertained with all the respect and favour the nature of her situation would allow; and the better to effect his orders, he fosook his cabin, and lodged her in it, charging his servants to attend, her with as great diligence as on himself; so that she might perceive, as they entertained her with civility, so they likewise honoured and respected her, by never once attempting to violate her chastity, which , she esteemed more precious than her life.

Notwithstanding this unexpected indulgence, she could not forget her lost Medor :—she wept, as if his absent idea had a regal prerogative to create her tears, and lamented the unfortunate accident that had lately befallen her.—In her
contemplations she ruminated upon his absence, and her own present misery,frequently bursting into public exclamations.

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 115

The captain perceiving her distress, used his best endeavors to sooth her sorrows; telling her at the same time, that no proceedings should be exercized against her, and that such respect should paid her, as her truth and constancy deserved; she having previously made the captain acquainted with her whole history. Leaving the princess in the captain’s possession,
making the best of his way for Constantinople, we shall return to Plivio and Mersilva,

116 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

CHAP. XIII.
Plivio being acquainted with Thalmos success with the princess Athelia, resolves to
renew his suit.—He goes to the court for that purpose, and hearing that Mersilca, with the queen and her attendants, were taking the diversion of hunting, he determines to join the chase.—By some accident Mersilva loses sight of the company, and is overtaken by a young lord, named Blithion, one of the party; he attempts her virtue, but is unexpectedly defeated in hisbrutal attempt by the arrival of Plivio, from whom he meets his death.

PLIVIO being informed of his cousin Thalmo’s proceedings, and of the success he had met with in his amours, began to conceive some hope that by the

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 117

intercession of the princess Athelia, he should obtain his beloved Mersilva.—Upon which he hasted to the court in order to renew his suit; and on being informed that the princess, with the queen, Athelia, and their attendant lords and ladies were hunting in the forest, he immediately repaired thither in order to join the royal company; being fond of the diversion, though, at this time, particularly so, that he might behold the beauty of the fair Mersilva.

In the midst of the forest, it happened, that the stag escaped from their sight, which caused the company to take different routs in order to find him out, and to renew the chase.-—-Among the rest, there was a young lord named Blithion, that had long conceived a passion for the princess Mersilva, but could never get

118 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

an opportunity of disclosing his affection.

It so happened, that the princess lost sight of the company, and ranging discontentedly, as if her courage had been vanquished with despair, she was unfortunately met by this young lord, who being overjoyed with the opportunity that prefented itself, without any ceremony, Saluted her in the following indecent manner.

“Madam,
“I have a long time laboured under many perplexities which your divine beauty has been the cause of;—and since fortune is now so favourable to me, I beseech you, let us enjoy the present opportunity; therefore, madam, stand not so much

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 119

on your punctilios of disdain, but consider with yourself where you now are;—the time,—the place.—At present you are destitute of assistance, and your life and honour are at my disposal;—I will not be denied with refusals, nor deluded by delays;—for in spite of fortune, I must satisfy my love, and reap the enjoyment of my long desired expectation.
—To prevent the consequences that may ensue readily consent, otherwise you will oblige me, after enjoyment, to use you with such barbarity as my nature would scarce offer to your lovely sex, much less to you, madam, whom I have ever adored.

Mersilva, astonished at his brutal behaviour, began to weep,—and sighing as if her breast would rend asunder with insupportable grief, called on the divine powers

120 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

to preserve her innocence, and to shelter her from the rapine of this cruel lord;—however, considering that silence was a demonstration of consent, she resolutely made the following reply.

“If, Sir, you had ever been trained up in the school of virtue, you would have tempered your words with discretion, and not presumed to offend a chaste lady’s ear with such obsdenity; and since your tongue has uttered that which cannot be recalled, know, thou tyrant, that I despise thy threats;—I am myself the guardian of my honour, and will protect it with my life; —therefore, with speed depart, and bid adieu to your barbarous designs.

“ Madam,” said he, “it is in vain to resist where there is none to rescue you; yet

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 121

were Hercules himself present, he should not debar me from my purpose.”

“Inhuman Lord,” replied the princess, “since reason will not allay your cruelty, in permitting me to depart without blemishing my honour, be assured that, rather than consent to thy lascivious demand, I will voluntarily be the instrument of my own death.”

Blithion, not moved with remorse* but still burning with inordinate desire to extenuate the sire of his insatiable lust, thought every minute a month, before he had perfected his diabolical enterprize;—and taking her by the trembling hand, he began to embrace her:—Plivio, at this instant appeared in sight, and hearing the cries of a person seemingly in distress,

122 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

came unexpectedly to her assistance; which the princess perceiving, cried out, “Plivio, as you tender my affection, and value my honour, assist your unfortunate Mersilva;—preserve me from this inhuman monster, and let him meet the reward due to his crimes.”

Plivio perceiving it to be his dear Mersilva, enflamed with revenge, he stew to the spoiler, and plunged his sword into his breast; where, receiving his reward, he fell to the ground, and instantly expired.

CHAP. XIV.
The princess Mersilva recovers from the fight, and, with Plivio, immediately join the company, to whom they relate their adventure.—The queen informs the king of Plivio’s generous behaviour to the princess.—The king rewards him with a command in the army.—He renews his suit to the princess, but meets with little encouragement.

The princess, after returning thanks to her deliverer, related to him the whole proceedings; which, when he understood, he thanked the stars for making him the happy instrument of her delivery.—Mersilva being pretty well recovered, he again mounted her on her milk-white steed, resolving to find out the queen;—to whose presence they were no sooner arrived, than he gave a relation of this adventure, which Mersilva verified

124 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

by a fresh shower of tears; which, like dew on damask roses, distilled on her lovely cheeks. The queen, together with the princess Athelia, and the rest of the ladies were greatly rejoiced at her delivery, and gave Plivio, incessant thanks for his undaunted courage. The queen likewise assured him, that she would use her endeavours to bring about their happy union.

They then left the forest, and returned to the court, where they were no sooner arrived, than the king was made acquainted of what had happened;—he highly commended the prince for his valour; and, as a mark of his approbation, appointed him to an honourable command; which added more hope to his desired enterprize, and made him not a little rejoice at the accidental event of wuch good fortune.	i

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 125

Perceiving himself greatly in favour with the king and queen, and likewise in the princess Athelia’s, being so nearly allied to Thalmo; and finding that his adored Mersilva could reap no satisfaction but in his presence, he determined to lose no time, therefore he hasted to her apartments, where, finding her alone, he amorously addressed himself to her:

“Madam, all alone a kiss of your fair hand for your best thoughts.”—“Not alone, Sir,” says she, “for my thoughts are my best companions; yet my contemplations are so frivolous, that less than what you speak of may purchase them.:

The prince was overjoyed to fee her in so facetious a humour, and resolved to continue his discoursee:

126 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS,

“Why, fair Mersilva, less than a kiss from your fair hand, or a smile from
these lips, is in effect nothing;—and ladies will scarce thank their lovers with so slender an affection.”—“Indeed Sir,” says she “ I will prove to the contrary, for they are many times so effectual, that it raises their lovers to so great a height of ambition, that they frequently take too much privilege.”

“But, madam,” replied Plivio, “these are shadows without substance— for there is great difference between pretense and performance—for the one is the others contrary:—And taking her hand, he advanced it to his lips,- and kissed it; —whereupon, with a sharp rebuke, she
said;

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 127 

“Sir,
“I little thought your proceedings would have been so peremptory !— for had I but once judged your actions would have been of so large an extent, my absence should have given you an utter denial.”

The prince seeing her patience a little moved, thought to balance his offence, with an humble answer; and replied,

“Madam,
Your anger carries such a power, that whatever course it steers, it sits triumphant.—Had I thought my innocent actions would have so soon incurred your displeasure, I would have prevented, by my care, what has happened.”

128 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

To this the princess replied, “I now see, that it is my favour, which is the occasion of this disorder -therefore, to avoid the like for the future, you may, as you came, depart, and return when you are sent for.’*

“Madam, said the prince, if the demonstrations of my passion has created in you this displeasure, I beseech you impute it to my affection, which was the chief occasion;—and, as a reward for my crime, inflict on me what punishment you think will be equivalent to the offence.”

The princess blushed at this answer, but, in such a manner, as if love and disdain sat on her cheeks, striving for supremacy: however, considering she had gone

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 129

so far, and that the subject whereon she had grounded her anger was so small, she suddenly took her leave, and without farther ceremony left the prince to his private meditations.”

130 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

CHAP. XV.
The princess returns to Plivio—Having obtained sufficient proofs of his constancy and affection, she acknowledges her passion for him, and meets with a suitable return.

PLIVIO was greatly astonished at her ungenerous treatment, yet determined to wait for her return;—and taking a book in his hand, he sat himself down to read, in order to divert his melancholy.—In a short time, however, the princess returned, and pretending astonishment to see him present, forgetting her former behaviour, asked him pleasantly, what wind brought him thither?—To which, with a deep sigh, he replied;——

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 131

“Madam,
“It is your cruelty that hath created my sorrows, and if you did not triumph over my misery, you would, with justice, pity my unhappy situation;—therefore, madam, I beseech you, be not prolix in those favours you are pleased to bestow on me, but rather let me know my destiny, whether 1 shall live your admirer, or die your martyr.”

The princess observing with what fervent zeal he pleaded, instantly returned him this answer:

“Plivio, your value and virtue, having combined their force in the bond of unity, hath, long since, in my breast, made way for your affection:—and though I have

132 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

hitherto refrained discovering my affections, impute it not to the defect of my benevolence, but rather to the zeal which I had to make proof of your constancy.—But now I call the gods to witness, that, from my heart, I adore none but Plivio, the morning star of my felicity.”

“The prince was now completely happy, and thought himself over-paid for all his former anxieties.--“Divine Mersilva,” said he, “ if my tongue could express, or my mind discover the never-dying fidelity which is imprinted in my breast, I should acknowledge myself bound to nature, and indebted to art, for enduing me with so great a felicity.—Yet, I beseech you to believe, that I have grounded my constancy upon so sure a foundation, and my fidelity upon so firm a

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 133

a resolution, that neither the alluring events of prosperity, nor the terrifying threats of misfortune, can either extenuate by flattering shadows, or extinguish by frowning substance; let the memory of our tender affections, break the waves of discontent; and let the novelty of our friendship, triumph over insinuating disconsolation;—the gods seem to sympathize
our amity, and Fortune herself delights to crown our friendship.—Despair is the path to destruction;—therefore, cheer up your spirits, and let a pleasant countenance gild the face of day; and to retaliate your affection, take my heart and hand, as a pledge of my immortal constancy.

Mersilva was well-pleased with the return of his affection, and comforted herself with the assurance of his fidelity.—


134 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

“Dear Plivio,” said the princess, “being heretofore a prisoner, I am now, by your kind aid and assistance, set once more at liberty:— yet, when I remember the king, my father, I cannot forbear weeping, that I should so unadvisedly bereave him of a daughter.—However, with an assured hope, that you will perform no less than you promise, I vow to be wholly yours, and none but death shall separate us.”

Having passed the day in amorous parly, and given a mutual exchange of vows, Plivio prepared for his departure;——and taking the princess by the hand, with a sigh, he gave her this friendly farewell:

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 135

“Dear Mersilva

“I must now be constrained sot leave you to your contemplations; but I will immediately repair to my closet, andthere contrive the means of establishing
our future tranquillity:—therefore, till I am again made happy by enjoying your
company, I take my sorrowful leave.

CHAP. XVI.
Plivio informs his cousin Thalmo of his success with the princess Mersilva.—Thalmo mentions his desire to return home.—Plivio consents to go with him.—They discover to the ladies their birth and parentage, with their real names, and their intentions of leaving the court of Zanfara.—The ladies resolve to join their company.—They depart the next night without molestation

PLIVIO having now attained the love of Mersilva, he went immediately to his cousin Thalmo, to whom he related the event of his proceedings, and the prosperous conclusion of his amorous enterprize.-——Thalmo was well pleased

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 137

pleased with his success, and asked him, “if his lady was contented to leave the court, and travel with him.”—He told him he had mentioned it to her, and her reply was very effectual that she would accompany me as far as confines of the world would permit, or I desire.”

“Why then,” replied Thalmo, “the princess Athelia and Mersilva, sympathize in one agreement; and hath vowed no more than Athelia desires to perform—To reside here is but folly; and as we have long been absent from our native country, it is now time to think of returning; therefore, let us hasten our departure, lest our loves be discovered, and our hopes crossed by envy, in the blossoms of their maturity.—To avoid future consequences, let us, in private,
convey

138 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

the ladies away; for, if the report of our departure should reach the cars of the king, he will, without doubt, use his utmost severity against us, and either depriving us of our loves or liberties.”

Plivio listened attentively to his cousin’s advice, and approved of the design: in this determination, each departed to his lady, to inform them of their resolution to return to their native country ; and not only discovered to them their births, but also their real names, which till this time had been kept a secret from all:—The ladies, you may be sure, were still better pleased with their Choice, and without further ceremony, gave themselves up entirely to their disposal.—The Royal Adventurers having apparent proofs of each others

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 139

affection, and being desirous to leave the court of Blithion as soon as possible, they agreed to set out the next night, between twelve and one, from the outer gate of the palace, and there to wait the arrival of the ladies; which warning, though short, seemed agreeable to all parties.

The hour being come, they failed not to be in readiness to receive the ladies, and waited their arrival with the utmost impatience.—The ladies, on their part, came at the time and place, appointed, where they were received with open arms; no words could they utter, because their tongues, by the power of love, were devoted to silence.—-Just at their arrival, an alarm was given in the palace, which so amazed them, that they knew

140 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

not how to save themselves, nor where to convey the ladies;—however, as they had gone so far, they were determined to escape, or perish in their enterprize.—The alarm increasing, and Thalmeno finding their affairs desperate, and perceiving that he must either lose his own life, or that of his dear Athelia’s, which he esteemed far more precious, reassuming his courage, said to Plivio, ‘This is no time for dallying, therefore, with courage, lead forth your lady, and if any presume to stop your passage, instantly make way with your sword, but do not shed unnecessary blood;—for you, fair ladies, fear nothing, your virtues are a sufficient bulwark for your preservation.”

This said, they went hand in hand through the outer gate, without interruption; where they found their pages, each with

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 141

with a horse, ready to attend them. After rewarding them for their fidelity, and enjoining them to secrecy, they mounted their steeds, and, under cover of the night, in a short time pasted through the town and suburbs, without interruption:—Day-break appearing, they began to consider what course to take, and resolved to go through the woods, the better to Shelter them from the sight of any person that might be sent in search of them.

142 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

CHAP. XVII.
Messengers are dispatched in search of the ladies, who are supposed to be taken away by Thalmeno and Palmos, but without effect—Travelling through a forest, they find a cottage, where they alight for refreshment, and find it inhabited by prince Medor, mentioned in the former part of this book—Thalmeno acquaints him of Florina’s retirement, and offers to conduct him to her, which he readily accepts of.

Athelia, and her companion, the princess Mersilva, not appearing the next day as usual, caused a general alarm throughout the palace—their apartments were starched—their intimates and acquaintances questioned—and a general hue and cry was spread

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 143

throughout the whole city.—But all without effect—not the least intelligence could be obtained, nor any idea formed of their escape, till it was known, that the two knights of Arabia were likewise missing.—The king and royal family immediately conjectured that they had carried them off; and messengers were dispatched in search of them, who all took different
routs, and returned without their errand.—The king and queen were inconsolable for the loss of their only daughter, and felt more than a parent’s grief; however, they lived in hopes that time would restore her to their longing arms, and that her future conduct might make amends for the rash and unadvised step she had taken.

By this time the adventurers were got many leagues from Zanfara; and no
longer

144 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

longer under any apprehensions of being pursued:—as they were riding by a forest’s fide, they saw a pleasant cottage, which both Athelia and Mersilva were desirous to enter, and requested their princes to alight, and accompany them; who chearfully complied, being glad of the opportunity, of getting them refreshment,

On entering the forest, they directed their way to the cottage, and were no sooner entered, than they beheld a young man. Seemingly overcome with grief, numbering on a green bank, with a book, pen, ink and paper close by him. At the sight of these unexpected visitors, he raised himself from the bank, whereon he lay, and thus addressed himself to them:

The ROYAL ADVKNTURERS. 145

“Gentle Strangers,
“Admire not my sorrows, nor wonder at my disconsolateness, as fortune hath invested me with this miserable calamity;— but to extirpate his tyranny, and to triumph over his usurpation, I have solitarily taken myself to this grove, to live, though not so well contented as I could wish:—my rural cottage affords no dainties, but poverty  yet, such as it is, if you please to accept it, I shall think myself honoured —and in whatever it comes short of your expectation, I will supply in freeness of service and thanks.”
T
he ladies perceiving his good humour, and the nature of his kind offers, thought themselves far indebted to his bounty and Palmos returned him this friendly answer :

146 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

“Sir,
“The friendship which in our travels you are pleased to afford us, are of that extent, that we absolutely confess ourselves so much your debtor, and we must own our weakness to be such,
that we cannot repay you with a just recompence for your unmerited favours; however, we return you our hearty thanks for your extraordinary humanity, assuring you, at the fame time, that if ever any favourable subject prsents itself, wherein we can retaliate your civility, you will find us so willing that the effects thereof shall not tax us with ingratitude.”

He had no sooner finished his speech, than the stranger took the ladies by the hand, and requested them with their companions

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 147

to enter another apartment, where he presented them with such refreshment, as his homely dwelling afforded ;—the repast being over, he asked the ladies to recreate themselves in the garden, to which they readily consented, and were attended by their lovers.—Passing thro’ a fragrant walk, planted with beautiful trees and flowering shrubs, they attained the entrance of a garden, beautiful beyond description,; after viewing the flowers and fragrant herbs, and tasting of the choicest fruits to avoid the excessive heats of the fun, they betook themselves to the bowers, where their beloved princes congratulated them with their happy welcome.—The stranger viewing their innocent familiarity, brought to his remembrance his past pleasures with the princess Florina; and, being willing to hide his sorrows, and to put on a face of chearfulness

148 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

while his guests continued with him, he withdrew to a private part of the garden, that his tears might not disturb the happineSs which they Ssemed to enjoy.

Athelia perceiving him at a distance, ruminating on his unhappy lot, began to surmise that he was in love with some lady, whose cruelty was the cause of his suffering; and pondering on his grief by her own sorrow, bewailed his misfortune, and compassionated his affliction.—They plainly perceived that their arrival had renewed his grief, and lamented to bring that afresh to his memory which proved his torment.—At length the ladies returned to the cottage, and in the way found a paper that contained the following words :

“The idea of Florina shall never depart my memory.”

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 149

After perusing the paper, they immediately thought Florina to be the object of his wishes; however, they took the paper to the princes, who were walking at some distance from them; and which they had no sooner read, but remembering the name of Florina, they began to conjecture that their kind host, was the person they had been in search of in the former part of their travels ; in order to satisfy their ardent desire, they went directly to the bower were he was seated, and Thalmeno thus addressed himself to him:

“Sir,
“I beseech you to satisfy me whether you are acquainted with the princess Florina, daughter to the king of Numidia, and whether you know prince Medor, son to the king of Biafara.”

150 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

He was greatly surprized at this question, and told the prince, that he once had the happiness to be acquainted with the person he named, and was the unfortunate Medor he enquired after;—unfortunate he called himself in being so long absent from from Florina, the memory of whose-divine beauty, had, for many months, been the subject of his devotions.—He therefore begged him to ease his tormented mind, by giving him all the information he could respecting his long lost princess.

Thalmeno replied, “Virtuous prince, as you have received us with such uncommon civility, I will no longer conceal from you those who are your debtors:—know, then, my name is Thalmeno, son and heir to the king of Cicilia; and this prince my cousin, son to the king of Egypt.—

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 151

Some two years since, we resolved to travel, and privately departed from my father’s court.—Directing our course to Africa, and journeying three days alone, destitute of a guide, and unskilful of the country, by chance we strayed into an unknown desart;-—but fortune, willing to intermix our bitter sorrows with some pleasures, conducted us to a lonely castle:—on our entrance we found the princess Florina, the desolate inhabitant thereof, who, having forsaken her father’s court, vowed there to remain, until the joyful return of your princely self. She relieved our wants, and made us welcome to what her habitation afforded, (without whose timely succour, we must inevitably have perished) and furnished us with means to pursue our travels.—This, sir, is all the information I can give you;—however, if you will honour us with your company, as we are

152 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

are bound for Cicilia, immediately upon our arrival, we will, with chearfulness, conduct you to the place of her solitary retirement.”

The prince was overjoyed at this un-expected news, and thanking him for his intelligence, promised to accompany them as soon as they thought proper to depart.—Medor, fixing his eyes upon the ladies, earnestly requested Thalmeno to inform him who they were, and what private occasion had induced them to travel;—the prince informed him of their whole proceedings, and of their desire to go to Cicilia—He admired their constancy, praised their virtues, and used his best endeavours to render his habitation agreeable to their wishes; at the same time, offering to be their guide, when they should think proper to depart.

CHAP. XVIII.
Medor conducts them to the sea side, where they meet with a ship, and sail immediately for Cicilia—In their voyage they fall in with a Turkish xebeque—and after an obstinate engagement she surrenders to them—Prince Medor is sent on hoard to take the command of her, and, to his great surprize, finds his lost Florina, a captive on board.

As Medor had offered to be their I guide, they immediately prepared for their departure, and were safely conducted through the vineyards to the seaside ;—where they were no sooner arrived, but they fortunately met with a ship that

154 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

had been forced to harbour there by tempestuous weather—glad of this unexpected opportunity, they agreed with the master for their passage, and in a few days, with a favourable wind, sailed for Cicilia.

At the entrance of the Mediterranean sea, they were becalmed in such a manner, that their ship made no way.—The master, having the night watch, heard the noise of oars plowing in the sea; and presently discovered a vessel making towards them: At this unexpected sight, he was greatly alarmed, and immediately prepared to receive them:—In about three hours they came within gun-shot, and a desperate engagement began, which lasted for some time, and terminated at last in their favour—many were killed and wounded on both sides—but neither the
princes,

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 155

nor their ladies received any hurt; the ladies indeed, as may easily be suspected, were much frightened, which the captain perceiving, gave them what comfort he could in their distressed situation, and advised them to be chearful; telling them, the danger was mostly over, and that by the morning, he did not doubt of being conqueror.—But, for their lovers, they behaved with undaunted courage during the whole engagement.

The prize proved to be a Turkish xebeque; and as soon as her colours were struck, the captain prepared to fend an officer on board.-----------  Thalmeno offered his service, and Palmos declared he would not stay behind—however, Medor feeing his companions in contention, resolved that they should both stay on board with their ladies; for, if the captain

156 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS:

captain was agreeable, he was ready and willing to go himself.

The captain, hearing his voluntary resolution, gave his consent, and under a discharge of cannon he went on board— Thalmeno and Palmos finding everything settled, and the danger over, left the deck, and retired to their cabin, where their ladies came to congratulate them of their great and fortunate victory.—Their pale complexions were changed to chearful countenances, and their mournful eyes, which were almost drowned in tears began to clear up; and, in short, both parties received a general satisfaction.

Medor being arrived along-side the prize, entered, with his boat’s crew, without opposition; and both officers and men laid down their arms, which Medor

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 157

perceiving, commanded his men, on pain of death, not to molest them, either in body or goods.—The captain stood on the quarter deck to receive him, and after the usual compliment, told him, that though it grieved him to be conquered by any, yet since he must endure the chance of war, he rejoiced in having become tributary to so worthy a commander.————I
must therefore acquaint you, that there is on board a lady, whom fortune has made my prisoner;—her extraction I know not, but if outward deportment describes inward qualities, I presume she is some lady of noble descent—her behaviour, though in adversity, is such, that she carries her perplexity with a modest countenance, and disdains to render herself tributary to the infidelity of Fortune.

158 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

He was no sooner aquainted with this circumstance, but desirous to know who his fair captive might be, than he requested the captain to take him to her presence, which he accordingly did, and found her lying prostrate in the cabin, drowned in tears, expecting the first that entered to be the harbinger of death.—But, fortunately for her, it happened otherwise!——for when she expected he would sheath his sword in her innocent breast, he took her by the hand, and with an humble voice, spoke these words to her:

“Arise, fair lady, your life and liberty is granted you;—and what more you may hereafter request, if in our power, shall, as soon as possible, be complied with.”

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

She remembered his voice, though they had been so long separated, and immediately raised herself from her bed of sorrow; and perceiving it was Medor that pronounced the welcome sentence, she put aside her veil, and, to his great surprize, discovered to him his long-lost Florina.—A second view confirmed his belief, and with open arms went and embraced her.

160 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

CHAP. XIX.
The happy meeting of Medor and Florina.—The prince informs her he is hound for Cecilia, she consents to go with him—-The princess prevails on Medor to set the prize at liberty, in return for the indulgence shewn to her, which he complies with—They return on hoard his own ship, where the lady is joyfully received by his princely associates.

“Dear Florina,” said he, taking her by the hand, “could I finish my days in thy embraces, or sacrifice the remainder of my life before thy divine deity, I should esteem myself most happy;—being, at last, freed from the chains of bondage, and from the fetters of despair,

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 161

I here present you with my constancy and fidelity; and, as I have long since devoted myself to your powerful charms, so I resolve to live and die your faithful admirer.”

Florina no sooner heard these words, than with an amiable, yet sorrowful voice, she returned him this answer:

“Dear Prince,
“Were I acquainted with that friendly power that hath given thee freedom, and reconducted thee to my presence, my sincere congratulation should inform you with what constancy I attended your coming, and with what sincerity I honour thy arrival:—since thy departure, my life has been a continual round of unhappiness; yet

162 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

in enjoying once more thy presence,
I bury the memory of all my former griefs in the grave of oblivion; invincible affection hath so captivated my spirits, that I live now only to respect you;—and, in spight of Fortune’s effects, resolve to die in the league of your desired friendship.”

The prince pondered upon her affectionate words, and not able to contain such ardent expressions, requested she would banish from her breast the memory of sorrow, and let contentment flourish in her mind:—“and, dear Florina,” said he, “since Fortune hath so ordained it, that now, contrary to my expectation, you are made my happy prisoner, know, empress of my thoughts, and angel of my imaginations, that, with most respectable company, I am bound for Cicilia, where, as soon

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 163

as we arrive, I will most willingly solemnize our nuptials, and fix the utmost limits of my hopes and happiness.”

Florina was well pleased with this fresh proof of his affection, and said, “Think not, dear prince, that having devoted myself to you, I repent me of my enterprize ;—I beseech you, on the contrary, lofs no time, but continue your course, that we may reciprocally enjoy the desired object of our immortal affections.”

The prince being uneasy till he had made his princely associates acquainted with his good fortune, requested the princess to make ready for her departure, that they might pursue their voyage to Cecilia. —To Cicilia! said Florina, with astonishment,

164 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

which Medor observing, desired to know the occasion of that sudden surprize:—to which she replied—since first I heard you mention the name of Cicilia, my present joys hath called to my remembrance my former miseries:—having, for your sake, sequestered myself from all company, and taken up my residence in a desolate castle, there unexpectedly came two strangers from Cicilia at whose earnest request, I informed them of the reason why I had cloistered myself from the world ;—they admired my constancy;—and, in return for some small favours that I afforded them, they protested solemnly to search you out; at least, if you were to be found in the confines of Africa.”

“And have you not,” replied Medor, “since heard of their adventurous proceedings?”

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 165

—No, “said Florina, “which much troubles me, as they were so commpassionate for my sorrows, and admirers of my affections.”

After making each other acquainted with their sufferings, Florina declared her resolution of accompanying him to Cicilia, or to any part of the world, rather than return to her father’s court. “Come, dear prince, said she, let us go from hence, and crown our miseries with the
triumph of content—Fortune, you know, is variable, therefore let us lose no time, while an opportunity presents itself—this favour, likewise, I do request, that these staves, who are made your prisoners, may without prejudice, have permission to depart freely, in return for the care and civility shewn me whilst I was their captive.”

166 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

The prince commended her for desiring the grateful return; and fending for the captain, he returned him his sword, telling him at the fame time, that he was once more at liberty to pursue his own course; and desired that his own boat might be immediately got ready with the.
men that came on board with him, which was soon complied with. The boat being manned, he was informed by the captain that all was ready for his departure; taking Florina by the hand, he conveyed her safely into the boat, and under a discharge of cannon, with a favourable gale, they were conducted to their own ship.

On his entrance, he conveyed Florina to his cabin; and then enquired for the princes, and being conducted to them, they congratulated his safe return, and asked him what success:—to which he replied,

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 167

“Instead of a rich prize, I have met with an inestimable jewel, the value of which cannot be cast up by the whole industrious science of arithmetic!”—“No, (said Athelia) why then I suppose you have taken all the mint of Mexico, or engrossed the minerals of Peru.” Indeed, ladies, I have not, (said the prince) and yet I divinely rejoice in possessing so sacred a present.”

The company was at a loss to guess what this valuable jewel could be; however Thalmeno told him, “that he supposed he had received some intelligence of the princess Florina, or seen the idea of her beautiful perfections.”—At the name of Florina, he could not help smiling, and stepping to his cabin, and stepping to his cabin, where he had left her, in a few minutes,
he presented her to them:—at the first sight

168 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

the princes conjectured her to be his long lost princess; but not able to justify their suspicion, looking at one another, they did not care to congratulate her by the name of Florina.—On the other hand, the lady remembered their faces perfectly well, and knew them to be Thalmeno and Palmos,—which they perceiving, immediately congratulated her on the happy event that had restored her to her favourite Medor. After receiving their congratulations, the prince introduced her to the ladies in these few words :

“Fair princesses, this lady, which I now present to you, is my admired Florina, whom I honour and adore as the goddess of my felicity.”—

Athelia and Mersilva hearing this, monstrated by their smiling countenances,


The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 169

that their hearts were inwardly filled with joy and gladness, and returned him this answer:——

“Prince Medor, we heartily congratulate you, on this unlooked-for happiness, and rejoice that Fortune hath at last smiled upon you in the happy arrival of your beloved Florina;”—whereupon they saluted her, and gave them a happy welcome.

The Royal Adventurers relate the most extraordinary and interesting circumstances of their travels—are interrupted by a violent storm arising—a scene of horror and confusion, but productive of the severest trial of love and friendship.

Words cannot describe the complacency that sat on the countenance, or the joy that reigned in the breast of each hero and heroine at this unexpected interview — which naturally
led them to reflect on their romantic excursion, and furnished a converzation at once interesting and entertaining.

Scarce were their congratulations and salutations ended, that Thalmeno opened

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 171

the pleasing converse:—“ I have often imagined, said he, but now find, that no circumstance in life affords more pleasure to the ingenuous mind, than the unexpected sight of a long absent lover, or a sudden interview with a generous-friend.

As I heretofore sympathized with the fair forelorn one in her distress, when in plaintiff accents she bemoaned the loss of a beloved Medor, torn from her arms by a cruel, an inexorable father, who opposed his inflexible evils to the ultimate happiness of a once most affectionate and obedient child; so I now feel an exquisite delight in having the present opportunity of congratulating them on the kind interposition of their better fortune; their auspicious stars, which seem to have crowned their mutual

sincerity, and all their past toils, by bringing about an event, as unexpected as prosperous, and affording them another occasion of renewing their plighted vows, and testifying the sincerity of their mutual attachment.—When bent on travel and romantic exercise, I strayed from my royal father’s domains, accompanied by my other Pylades, my dearest Palmos, I knew not of the power of all-conquering beauty; nor had I pondered on the mighty effects of captivating love, till chance directed us to your lonely, but hospitable mansion, where the generous Florina so benevolently administered to our necessities. We received on our departure, from her lily hand, a paper, wherein she had penned, the cause of her retirement, and all her poignant woe—she seemed then to live, only to deplore.

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 175	^

Pitying the fate of the disconsolate fair, we determined, noble Medor, as errants at large, to range the wilds of Africa, in quest of the object of her adoration ; persuaded that no incident in the course of our adventures, would give us more real satisfaction, than by apprising you of the seat of her retirement, to bring together two lovers separated by
cruel fate, but united in the bonds of an indissulable affection--We ranged, but in vain, through a vast tract, wild, desart, inhospitable and forlorn, without a clue to-guide us, till we fortunately encountered an antiquated dame, called Virtue, in a place where you would scarcely expect to meet that rigid lady—even the palace of Folly; a mansion adorned with all that can attract the age, or inflame the desire of mortals, deaf to the dictates of reason, and under the absolute government of

174 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

passion—Though young and inexperienced, we had the resolution to withstand the allurement of its female inhabitants, and shun those impure embraces which lead to disease and infamy—The
venerable matron, just before she vanished from our sight, lest her salutary counsel should not make a due impression and effectually influence our future conduct, left with us a summary of religion and morality, which we preserve as an invaluable treasure; and by which we are determined to regulate our lives and actions.

Time, and along and tedious course of travel, at length brought us to the spot wherein I received my first wound from the shaft of Cupid, and fell a victim to his piercing dart. But I found, to my extreme mortification, an ineffable pain; 

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 175

that the pangs of despised love, are by much more intolerable than the keenest stroke from the little god—

To love and not be loved—no tongue can express! no heart can conceive the piteous situation, but those on whom fate has entailed the curse—At length, the concealed passion burst forth involuntary, cheared my desponding spirits, and opened a dawn of hope that I should yet be happy—time confirmed my expectation, banished every thought, and accomplished my felicity. The beauteous Athelia professed her love, and the adventurous Thalmeno was more than blessed.—We now await the consummation of our happiness, and hope shortly to share in the general joy of a respective union.

Thus spake Thalmono, while the rest, but especially Florina, was all attention.

176 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

—Palmos confirmed the narrative and remarks of his companion; observed the similarity of their situation respecting the course of their love, and fervently joined in wishing the accomplishment of their general bliss. The late captive, but now the happy Florina, then begged leave to reply; being desirous to contribute to the pleasure and entertainment of the company, and pass the time agreeably during their confinement on ship-board,

“Noble princes, and no less royal fair ones (continued Florina) I rejoice to find, by this favourable incident, that we have been respectively rewarded in our love, for which we have undergone the greatest anxiety of mind, as well as bodily dangers and inconveniencies—fortune seems to have been peculiarly inteterested in our behalf, and to have directed
t

our course, once so remote from each other to one point, so that our joys are concentered. We have been adventures, and fortunate; brave, and obtained the prize; opposed dangers, and are crowned with the summit of our desires. I want language to express my feelings, when under the due apprehension of falling a prey to the Turkish slaves, I was so happily delivered by my faithful Medor, who like a guardian angel, rescued me from ignominy, and changed a scene of gloom and despair, into a refulgent paradise of joy and consolation.

Whilst Florina was thus descanting on the grateful theme, the ship’s company were alarmed by a dreadful squall, winch carried away the main top mast before they had time to take in their sails. This squall was succeeded by

178 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

a hurricane as boisterous as was ever known to the oldest mariners on board. The hatches were now nailed down, the dead lights put up, and every preparation made to secure them from the danger of a turbulent sea, the lofty surges of which threatened immediate death. It is natural to conceive that such a scene of horror and confusion must cause our female adventurers to tremble, and not a little affect even the heroes themselves.

So violent was the storm, that it struck a general terror and consternation, and nought was apprehended but immediate death. To confirm their fears, in the space of about an hour, through the violent concussion of the vessel, from the boisterous surges of a most disturbed sea, she sprung a leak, and the only probable means of safety was an incessant plying of
the chain pumps. One set of men followed

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 179

the other in a constant succession ; and so toilsome was the labour, that for the sake of relief, and strengthening each other for the indispensable duty, not a male on board was exempted from his turn. Our Adventurers, royal as they were, most chearfully acquiesced with the necessary injunction, and became an example to the crew of alacrity and resolution.

Nothing so essentially concerned them, as the security of the princesses, whose lives they preferred to their own, as their very existence depended thereon. They would, when disengaged from the generally successive toil, endeavour to solace them with assurance of a prospect that the rigour of the weather would soon abate, when they would be delivered from their fears, and enabled to renew the agreeable converse, that had rendered first

180 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

part of the voyage so pleasing and delightful. But so terrible was the apprehension of the fair ones, and so disordered were their whole frames by excessive sickness, all their efforts proved vain, and in spite of all they could do or fay, they wrung their hands, and smote their breasts, and shewed in their whole countenances, words and actions, excessive horror and frantic despair.

Palmos would recapitulate to his de-loved Mersilva; the danger he had undergone in bringing her off, after having protected her person and virtue at the peril of his life: Thalmeno would observe to the enchanting Athelia, the anxiety and torture he had encountered in gaining her affections, and the dauntless resolution he had shewn in bearing away his matchless prize, when an alarm

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 181

was given in the palace: Medor, to sooth the anguish of his constant Florina, recalled to her perplexed mind, the many proofs of their miserable attachment; that love was greatly enhanced by danger and difficulties, and that future hours of dalliance might be sweetened by the present most calamituous scene.

But all they could obtain from the respective objects of their desires, was a heart-felt sigh, and a look portraying at once, love and despair.—Finding all their efforts incapable of assuaging their grief and anguish: they therefore desisted from farther troubling them, and with the true spirit of heroism armed their minds for the uncertain event.—Nor was it long before the exigency of their cafe, called for the exertion of all their magnanimity.-—
The water encreased prodigiously in the hold;

182 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

notwithstanding their incessant toiling at the pumps, gave proof of the most imminent danger, and it was therefore resolved to take to the boats, and throw themselves entirely on the protection of heaven.—This being agreed to, the long-boat was first hoisted out, and some debate arising concerning precedency, the Royal Adventurers, with their drawn swords in hand, insisted, that the fair passengers should first be put on board, with v all possible decency; determined to oppose, at the hazard of their lives, any resolution that might be carried to the contrary.—But there was no occasion for the exertion or so laudable a Spirit; for the
wind abating considerably, the danger was consequently less: the boat was therefore hoisted in again; and they all agreed to betake themselves to pumping. In about six hours, the face of things was reversed;

the tempest subsiding, and being succeeded by fine moderate weather: This scene, however, with respect to the royal lovers, tended to confirm a very trite maxim; that circumstances of distress and danger, are the genuine, the only genuine test of love and friendship.

Our adventurers after this scene of distress, are favoured with the continuance of a fair wind; and with a pleasant gale reached the Cicilian shore, to the mutual Joy of every party.—Druyno recognizes his lost son with paternal affection, and Thalmeno, his royal father with filial duty.

The billows of the boisterous main thus assuage, and the regions of Neptune having assumed a pleasing aspect; the countenance of every one on board was happily reversed from horror and despair, to joy and complacency. The adventurous lovers reflected with pleasure on their delivery from a past scene of distress, and looked forward with

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 185	

delight to an approaching period of consummate bliss.

After the late toil and fatigue, it was natural for the master of the vessel to avail himself of the favourable wind, in order to reach the much desired haven; that each uneasy mariner might repose in an harbour of safety, sleep secure from alarming storms, and reap the fruits of laborious danger.

In about four days, having failed that whole time with a large wind, the man at the mast-head espied the coast of Cicilia, and hailing the master on the quarter deck, proclaimed the joyful news, which was echoed throughout the ship’s company.—The royal passengers, roused with the pleasing sound of “land, land,” leaving

186 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

the cabin, where they were conversing on the most rapturous subjects, and hastening upon deck, were congratulated on their making the coast of Cicilia.—Preparations were now made for landing; the cables were bent, the boats were rigged, the passengers changed their attire, and every thing on board had the appearance of pleasing expectations. A few hours wafted them within shore; the prospect of which, filled the mind of Thalmeno both with joy and apprehension; the former being raised from the sight of his native country, which he had long deserted, and the latter from the chastisement of an incensed parent, for his abrupt departure.

The Cicilians espying a vessel in the offing, repaired in multitudes to the bank, according to custom, and many looked through

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 187

through their telescopes, to ascertain the ship; which not being able to effect, a guard was ordered down to the beach, to defend them from any hostile attempt.

At length they came to an anchor, and a boat was immediately sent on board; when finding they were friends, a signal was given to those on shore; and they were immediately saluted from the fortress, by a discharge of cannon, which was returned from the vessel.—The ladies were then conducted on shore by the Royal Adventurers, and nothing can exceed the general pleasure and surprize of the surrounding multitudes, at the sight of their beloved, their amiable Prince Thalmeno.—With exclamations that rent the air, they hailed the arrival of the royal
youth, whom they had given up for lost,

188 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

and received him with all the loyalty due to his dignified rank, and exalted virtue.

Nor was he wanting in a suitable and becoming return, but received their caresses with a most engaging air, and winning affability.—The news had by this time reached the palace bf Messina, and a splendid retinue was dispatched to effort the prince and his companions to the royal presence.-—On the approach of their darling offspring, the king and queen,, at- '' tended by a brilliant train of courtiers,, went out to meet them, and received them in-a manner becoming their dignity.

After the ceremonies and congratulations, usual on such occasions were over, they proceeded to the palace of Druyno, who having, ordered all to retire but his son

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 189

Thalmeno, thus addressed him.—“ I am wanting in words to express the gratitude I owe to an all-bounteous Providence, for thus hovering over my deserted child, and bring my heir once more to my arms.—I am a doating father, fond to a folly of the only blessing given me by
heaven, when my head with age, was almost silvered o’er. Tell me, I conjure thee, tell me, wherefore didst thou leave thy most affectionate parents ; who cherished thee with unequalled fondness; and whose only care was to heap good upon thee, and expose thyself to the mercy of
foreign climes, wholly unknown, and a race of beings to whom thou wert an utter stranger. Were thy parents wanting in love, or wert thou wanting in duty?”

The obedient prince, with tears of contrition, having prostrated himself at the royal

190 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

feet, thus humbly and cordially replied.

“Deign gracious sire, to forgive the fallies of wandering youth, that prompted me to leave my royal father’s court, in quest of foreign climes, and regions distant far from my native land.—I left you not, from motives of disobedience, but from an unconquerable desire of seeing the manners and customs of other nations.—Though at that time I had attained only to the age of fifteen years, I had travelled much in books, and read mankind in the doubtful page of history. This excited my curiosity to be an eyewitness of the truth of what I read, nor could any thing but demonstration convince me.

“Thus resolved, I communicated the design to prince Palmos, who chearfully acquiesced

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 191

and accompanied me in the adventurous enterprise.—Nor have we lost by the random undertaking; having learned from experience, that, “virtue is the only nobility, and that to be good is to be happy.” We have visited the stately mansions of princes, and the lonely cottages of hermits; we have beheld life in its splendid and obscure state; scenes of vice and folly have been disclosed to our view, and we have been honoured with the salutary admonitions and safe counsel of virtue—In short, we have had a general view of men and things, and imbibed some most important maxims for our future conduct, in that exalted sphere of life, for which Providence seems to have designed us. But royal Sir, I have gained by my travels and researches, a prize of inestimable value; a jewel beyond compare; a princess beautiful, sage,
and

192 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

and virtuous ; possessed of every qualification, moral and personal, that can attract the eye, or charm the heart.—We have solemnly plighted our mutual vows, and only wait the permission of your majesty to consummate our bliss.”

The, good old king having most attentively listened to his son, with tears of joy, raised him from his knees, and admiring at once his resolution, sagacity, and virtue, most cordially embraced him, and not only assured him of his forgiveness, but his entire approbation of his
choice. With duty and gratitude, the Prince acknowledged his roya candour, and thus finished the private conference.

CHAP. XXII.
The nuptials of Thalmeno and Athelia, are magnificently solemnized, at the court of Messina, in preference of their royal companions, who are sumptuously entertained by Druyno. At length they depart for their respective kingdoms, and are made mutually happy, by the marriage union, and an entire possession of the hearts of their subjects. 


Thalmeno having given the king his father, a concise, but striking detail of his adventures; and enlarged particularly on the extraordinary qualifications of the princess Athelia,

excited in the royal mind, a desire of being assured of her posessing such rare perfections, and induced him, the first opportunity, to propose such questions to her as might at once found her genius and disposition. So pertinent were her replies, and so sagacious and humane her observations, that convinced at once of the goodness, both of her head and heart;
he thought himself happy in so accomplished a daughter; and his son doubly blessed in so matchless a consort. The queen likewise admired her condescension and affability; and the whole court was charmed with her amiable deportment. It is therefore no matter of wonder, that the royal pair consented to the union, and appointed a day for the solemnization of their nuptuals.

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 195

The joyful appointment diffused a general pleasure, and the whole palace rang with the found of Thalmeno and Athelia.—The prince with impatience imparted the happy news to his royal companions, who with extacy, congratulated him on the approaching bliss.

At lenghth the long wished-for day arrived, and was remarkably serene and pleasant, as if nature by her resplendency, concurred to adorn the brilliant scene, and stamped a mark of approbation on the union of two such distinguished characters. About noon the royal pair were conducted in solemn pomp to the temple, where the holy rites were celebrated, in the presence of the king, queen, a numerous train of attending nobles, and a croud of joyful applauding spectators.

196 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

After the ceremony was over, they returned to the palace, and were most sumptuously entertained at the royal board; at which, the princes Palmos and Medor, together with their intended consorts, Mersilva and Florina, made a most magnificent and brilliant appearance, and were remarkable in testifying their joys on the happy occasion.

With exquisite delight the youthful adventurers recounted their past difficulties, disappointments and danger, which indulgent heaven had now so amply crowned, with a reward transcending their most sanguine wishes. No more they wander through deserts, savage and
forlorn, nor need the hospitable aid of an anhappy princess, retired to a solitary castle, and devoted to perpetual melancholy;

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 197

or the friendly assistance of a venerable hermit, secluded from the pomp and vanity of a noisy world, and laudably resigned to study, reflection, and devotion. No more they heave beneath the pangs of despised love: or study under the guise of artifice to conceal a real flame of passionate desire. No more the faithful, constant Medor flies the court of an inexorable Agenor, or fixes his abode in a solatary cottage; where forgetting his former dignity, he lives but to remember his lost Florina.—No, Florina is found, and time will shortly crown their mutual constancy. The bliss of one pair is consummated, and that of the other approaches—Love and friendship never reigned more triumphantly, nor was social bliss ever more abundantly imparted, than in the present festivity.

198 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

Palmos and Medor continued some time after the solemnization of the nuptuals, at the court of Messina; and the three princes entered into the most solemn leagues of perpetual amity; and friendly vowing to assist each other against any hostile attempt from any foreign power, and always to depute an embassy to each other from their several kingdoms.

From the success of Thalmeno, his royal associates determined to follow his example, by repairing to their respective countries, prostrating at the feet of their sovereigns, recounting their enterprize, and soliciting the royal clemency. Accordingly, having prepared for their departure, and taken leave of the king, queen, and court, together with their princely companions, Palsmo, with his


The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 199 

dear Mersilva, embarked for Egypt, in order to advance to the palace of his father Blithgora  as did Medor with his beloved Florina, for Zanfara, hoping, after so long an absence, to sooth the obdurate Agenor into forgiveness and consent! An auspicious gale soon wafted
he adventurous princes to their respective kingdoms and fortunes, and fortune likewise crowned their love and constancy. Palmos, who was the delight of his parents, was received with open arms, vested with his former dignities, appointed a suitable retinue, and caressed much more than before his departure.

When they had a little recovered from the toil and fatigue of their journey from the sea coast, which was very long and tedious, the prince presented the lovely

200 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 

Mersilva to his royal parents; recounting to them her many rare endowments; that he had protected her virtue, and conducted her person, at the hazard of his life, and therefore solicited their approbation of his choice, and concurrence in his design of espousing her according to the rites and ceremonies of his country.

The king then interrogated the lady as to her opinion concerning the request of his son; and on her blushing consent, confirmed the proposed union, and fixed the morrow for perfecting the happiness of the adventerous pair—who, impatient of awaiting the long anticipated joy, counted each hour, each minute, each moment of the tardy-gaited night, till Aurora dispelled the fable cloud, and ushered in the

The ROYAL ADVENTURERS. 201

morning dawn.—That auspicious day joined these constant lovers in the bands of Hymen, though they were long before united in the bond of affection.—Thus then they also were completely
blessed.

Nor was the heart of the obdurate Agenor so impenetrable, as to withstand the tears and solicitations of prostrate beauty, of the fair Mersilva entreating pardon, and his royal permission to resign her person and fortune to him, who, next to his royal self, had the greatest title to them, even the virtuous Medor, who had evinced his sincerity by the most indubitable testimonies; and whom providence had appointed her mighty deliverer from slavery, as well as

202 The ROYAL ADVENTURERS.

the valiant protector of her chastity. The once inflexible king now recoiled at the
representation of his daughter, nor hesitated to comply with her importunate request. Medor and Florina were therefore made one, and their attachment was cemented by an inviolable and mutual affection.

We now at length find virtue and friendship amply rewarded in these three illustrious pair, who lived loving each other, and beloved of all around them, till death summoning their aged parents to pay the debt of nature, they succeeded to their thrones, and long enjoyed the greatest blessing of princes, which is, to reign in the hearts of their people.
