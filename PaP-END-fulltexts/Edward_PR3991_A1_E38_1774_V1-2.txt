As Your Majesty is ac-

to publish this little produc-

Your Royal Patronage, will, 
I am certain, lead you ex-
cuse its want of that merit 
which might have envied it to 
such an honour.

The world, Madam, has 
so many daily instances of
Your worth,' that it would 
be vain, and impertinent tau-
tology, to expatiate on those 
qualities which this nation is 
so senstble You possess; nor 
could I find words sufficiently
expressive of the grateful feel-

LETTER I.
To Lady Margaret P.
YOU accuSe me for my silence' —yet why condemn me unheard?--perhaps I have a
stronger claim to your pity, than your difpleaSure. — You tell me, “that I am Surrounded by a croud of beaus, VoL,^I,	B	who

2 EDWARD.
who are afiiduous to entertain^], and oblige me, while you are reduced to Seek amuSement in the dull Scenes of rural life — which fills you with Spleen and ennui.”—If things were really as you represent them, you would have little cauSe to be offended with me. The wretch who can negledl a friend, a valuable friend, must be of all beings the 'most trifling, and should fink below your contempt.—If (as I am almost certain you will Soon find) you have been too hasty in your conclusion, I think you will be Sorry you could Suffer yourSelf to be unjust ; perhaps, if things were explained 1 should have reaion to chide in my turn. My quitting England was a filly step, and I fhall repent it all my life, but I did it from a laudible motive: indulgent heaven judges our intentions, and his ap-,	probasion
A N o V E L.	3
probation is not to be directed by incidents.
ft3 Ypu desire a particular account of all which has happened to me since I left you. -To Satisfy your curiosity I Shall obey, but ready as I always am to oblige you, I feel I must take time to accomplisii Such a Severe talk.— The mind asserts her own freedom, and is not to be commanded; and indeed I never was leSs inclined than at preSent, to begin a tedious journal of my life. You have drawn a striking contrast between our situations — but are you Sure I am So happy ? Does the heart feel one jot the easier for all the pomp and pagentry of greatneSs ? Can the glitter of gaudy trappings inSure health and peace ? Yes, Surely, gold is So general a Specific, that none can be miserable who posseSs it.—Very B 2	sine

fine reasoning, my dear P----; Such
are your Sentiments, and yet I am
convinced you will one day change
them____HappineSs is not the portipn
of mortality: lifers a com pound iof nie i ^. ..Duo? good and evil; a cup, which i%
fweetned with blefiings, and: embit-
tefed by adversity.—This fluduating
state is wifely calculated^ to remind
us of that futurity, which we Should
Be apt totally to forget, if we wer&
permitted to revel in delight without
being Sometimes intruded on by thoSe
unwelcome guests, anxiety and pain.
^ Blit I am grave; 'you think me na'pp^, and why Should 1 wisti' fO destroy an illusion which gives ybu Satisfaction.
. I met your friend T —— since my arrival, he is just the Same creature f “ ^	as
A Novel;	5
as when you last Saw ham ; time, which changes most things, has favoured him. I am to inform you, that he is now quite the father, admonishing infants of fix foot high, and I alTure you, his little girl is as thoroughly accomplished as any lady of three years old can be.—His wife |s a pretty little woman; there is a pleasing refemblance between them. When I told him my opinion, she worthy man feemed to expand with fatisfaction, and has been much my stave ever since: a little degree of just praiSe Seldom fails of pleasing — even men of understanding cannot resist its instuence, and to make others good humour’d to us, we must (if posiible) make shem pleafed vdth themSelvcs. ■— His is an honest pride, B 3	and
6 EDWARD.
and all good hearts would wish to gratify it.
I have not been (as yet) at any public place ; when I go to the Rotunda, you shall have a description of it, but don’t expedl long letters — when in my power, it will give me infinite Satisfadfion to asifure you by my pen (fince adfions are denied me) how much I always am your ladyship’s affectionate

idea
A N o v E L.	7
idea this obliging attention of his might raiSe in her boSom.-^Though to do her justice. She does not Seem to know her numberleSs perfections, or, if stie does, stie is So well Satisfied with the affection of one honest man, that the admiration of a gay croud, has no charms for her ; Site is full as well entertained with the prattling of her little infant, as a modern dame could be with the tricks oh a favourite monkey, and Ihe stupidly prefers her hushand to the first rate mac-caroni. —The sincere friendstsip he has for i;;y fit it Shy \v.;.s iU'. ijKbu'C'v: vUt Is4* his civility, but 1 am perSuaded the' frequency of his visits are owing to my listening with heart-felt Satisfaction to the encomiums of his wife, during which, his face is strongly exprefiive of the delightful fenSations B 4	of
8 E D Wq A
of his heart, andshe is perfectly hsin^-Some at that moment. Thus virtue has the power of -adding beauty,.to her votaries—while vice distorta-tlie most lovely form, and we view with diSgust, what, if properly ^ applied, would have inSured our admiration^
In my last, I promiSed to deScribe the Rotunda, and my having becBi there last night renders it ealy, for me to perform that promiSe. It is built in imitation of Ranelagh, but has no chimney in the middle, by which means the comfort of walking is destroyed.—There are recestes in it for tea, which we have, if we chuSe it, but the Shilling which we pay only gives us liberty to walk, and hear the muSick and Songs.— I find that when there is a ball there,
thole
Novel.	9
thoSe receffes are for Supper; and th^ middle of the room is railed in for minuets and country dances. If you were to go to a publick place here, with the idea of London in your eyes, you would find it diminutive indeed but if you could forget you had ever been at Almack’s, or Soho, you could not help being furpriSed at the number of well-dreffed women, Ireland is most certainly the court of Venus, unlefs stie (like us mortals) is not fond of having fo many who very ; nearly ' approach her in perfedlion.
It is impofiible to croSs^a street or walk in St. Stephens ^feenTn Sundays, without being puzzled to find where fo many beauties reside. You know, I never could admire any woman who Suffered affectation to creep B 5	like
lo EDWARD.-
like the conSuming moth upon her charms; and here is leSs of that disagreeable intruder than in most places. Good-humour and frankneSs are the chief charadferisticks of this nation; they are hoSpitable, I may Say, to a fault, for every stranger here meets with uncommon civility ; the natives contend who stiall be most obliging; nor need any gentleman, unlefs he chuSes it, enter a tavern during his residence among them.
I have met with a very friendly
reception from Mrs. S---. Her
hushand is a very worthy man, and has but one fault; let thoSe who know him, find what that fault is; she is a good-natured woman, and.. Seems happy j and it is a maxim of
mine
A. Novel.	ii
mine to hope appearances are not deceitful. ■ ‘ •
Our plays are but indifferently performed. Mrs. Barry, indeed, has met with that applauSe which thoSe who can distinguiSli merit must always give her. Ah, alas! poor Barry, he is no more that Romeo, So universally admired ; age has made Sad ruin there — I Saw him in Rha-dimistes, and Mrs. Barry in Zenobia ; stie is as excellent as Garrick, — universal in every Scene, and great in every part.
I am Sorry to inform you of the
death of Lady T-------d; She was
much beloved, and is truly lamented, I Saw her laid out in what vvas called B 6	state,
12 EDWARD.
state, but it was'miferablyTet off.— The light was Seen through the thin gauzey black. She lay on a table with pages at her head and feet, and part of the velvet of the pall thrown aside to let us fee the plate which told her name, &c. and which was silver 5 though embalmed, a disagreeable Smell overcame the Spices, and was a lesion against pride. In this Solemn Scene were a parcel of gay,— unthinking simpletons, leaning on the coffin, and talking over fafhions and halr-dresiers, while in her last habitation, lay a woman, whoSe looks, but a few days ago, - could have silenced all their chattering, and whole single word was almost a law. But ffie now Soars aloft in the vast regions «f eternity. Alas! my dear Lady Mar-
- garot.

LETTER III.
To Mrs, Mr.... %
YOU cannot think, my dearest madam, how much I am
I
charmed with your last letter j indeed you do no more than justice to^ x^y heart, when you believe it incapable of change j and you very justly observe the impoffibility of commanding^ our time, when we are not at
home.

home; Strangers who iare attentive have a right to Some compliment in return, and the constant hurry that complaisance has kept me in, is, 1 hope, a Susticient apology for my silence. There is leSs form, and more Society in Dublin, than in any place I ever was in before. Ail the people of fastiion know one another; but it has the inconvenience attendins: all Small towns. Scandal is predomi-nent, and forces good-nature out of doors. There are a few news-retailing mistes, and old ladies, who trot from houSe to houfe to Spread the stan-derous tale. I have always obServed, sthat the ugliest of the Sex are most apt to be ill-natured. Envy excludes.all other ideas; they have not one contemplation of their own which can give a moment’s pleasure; their minds are un-
Surnished,
A N O V E L.	15
furniflied, and few people chuSe to reside in a waste houSe; detradfion therefore becomes the Sole objetst of their delight; they enjoy the Satisfaction of giving pain, and many there are who Suffer torture from their own venom. MiSs B—— is one of this cast; She is for ever gadding about in this manner, and it matters not whether the story is of death — or the lofs of fame, So she can give distress to Some worthy heart. She
came yesterday to Mrs. S-------, where
I was, and had hardly Sat down, and hurried over the uSual compliments, before she informed us that young Mr. M— (who had just bought a troop) died that morning, A young lady who was in the room changed, colour, and 'Seemed ready to faint. She was a relation of Mr. M — ’s, and
I after-
i6 E D W A R D.
I afterwards found She was privately engaged to him j but the unfeeling MiSs B — went on telling all the aggravating circumstances of his death. His mother and sisters joined part of their little fortunes to purchaSe a troop for him,—-not chusing to let preferment go over his head. He was to repay them when he got posiestion of a large fortune to which he was heir: his character fhe extolled, (becaufe he was dead) and gave him all the merit which could endear him to Society, and lender his mother and sisters inconSolable. A dutiful Son, and an astectionate brother, are lost for ever to them, and, within a trifle, alt they had is alSo gone.
Now added stie, the girls have ruined their fortune—they must give
up
A^'NoWiJi.d tf
up'many of their airs, forego all ihoSe amuSements of which they were fo fond, and reside in the country. “ I hope Some of their friends will ad*^ viSc them to this prudent step, and “ prevent them from exposing them-“ Selves to the world, who will only “ laugh at their romantick folly ; and “ will not be So ready to praiSe their “ beauty, as when their brother’s ge-“ nerous disposition gave theni almost a certainty of an increaSe to their “ wealth.” The lively Mifs H—in-treated her not to be in pain for the MiSs M—s, who never could want admirers, while virtue and beauty had any. Mifs B— gave her a riialicion^ glance—but was aw’d into silence.^ She had told her story—and sighs were the only anSwers She received, which convinced her we did ^ not>capprove
of
L
i8 EDWARD.
of her mode of thinking; She therefore left us—and I dare fay went off* to thoSe whom fhe knew would rejoice in the humiliation of the amiable MiSs M —s. MiSs H— is one of thoSe whoSe looks prejudice us in their favour—and which inSures SenSe and goodneSs of heart-- but when ffie opens her lips. She has all that cle-verneSs which gives a zest to conversation. I never heard her fay one word which could raiSe a diSagreeable Sen* Sation in any breast.

ers. She is rich, and is yet perfedfly free; her Servant and her chair are her .only expences. She makes. Mr. S — happy with her company, and yet contrives a genteel method of making ample amends for any additional trouble file may occasion, for She is not of a nature to be out-done in kind-neSs. The first Paris hair-dreffer could not Set her out to more advantage than She does herSelf; she Spares only to have it more in her power to do good j the poor distrefifed families, with which most cities abound, bldo her every tiiiw they eat, drink, or rife; if you knew her as well, you would be as fond of her as I am. The haughty and over-bearing only feel the keen edge of her wit, and MiSs B—, of

Mrs. D-— is not yet married though fhe does all flie can to gain admirers and make conquests; ‘’bbi fhe is not formed for it, and if fhte docs at last Succeed, it will be only by means of her fortune. That indeed may buy her a hushand. Her hosiSe is elegantly furnished, a vast quantity of plate decks her side-board, and the bank is well stocked with her money. She is noily by way of iTiirth, and affedts romping to she\v her youthfulneSs. She rifes when she pleaSes, goes where her fancy dictates, and her coach obeys her orders in five Seconds of her clock; and yet, with all theSe advantages, she is in a violent hurry to give up her liberty

LETTER IV.
To MiSs N—.
IF my pen has not told you fo often as I could wiSh, how much I esteem you, you only are to blame, since it is you who have infected me with your lazineSs, and which I have often regretted. I have received your very Short letter, and thank you for the great news it contained. No doubt the town would rejoice at
Mr.
A Novel.	23
Mr. Garrick’s recovery, but he must go Some time or other; they ought therefore to prepare themSelves for a lost; which I fear never can be repaired. I feel mySelf interested in what is really a publick cauSe : however, for the future you will oblige me more, if you will mention your-Self alone, which to me will be infinitely more pleasing than any other intelligence. You have Suffered Severely by the lofs of fo many valuable friends ; the knot once loofened, we have reaSon to fear that others will daily fall; and when we consider our situation in this life, the uncertainty of our stay in it, and all the numberlefs diSeafes attendant on our nature, we ought rather to be astonished that we live fo long, than that numbers drop. Mortality is
ever
Z4 EDWARD.
ever in our view, and yet we Seem to know as little about it, as if it was Some outlandiSh monster. I feel for you as much as a perSon can feel, who is Severely afstidted with a pain in the eye, leg, or arm. You are as much a part of mySelf, as either of thoSe members, and what you Suffer, gives me equal distrefs. Indeed you are extremely dear to me, and I am certain you cannot doubt it, nor need I apply for any other aid, than what will flow from your own just reflection, which I am convinced will instruct you how far you ought to grieve. Our Sufferings can only be alleviated by a firm reliance in a future state. This confidence gives us comfort. Adieu. A train of ideas croud on me, and I dare not Suffer
mySelf

From the Sa.me, to the Same.
Your last gave me sincere Satisfaction. You no longer torment me with Garrick and Paoli; but your own health, which is infinitely dearer to me, is become your Subject, and I rejoice to find it is in the state I wiSh it. I by no means would have you write long at a time, I am certain any thing So Sedentary would hurt you ; but without prejudice, once a fortnight, you might VoL, I.	C	indulge
/

indulge me with a tew Jines, i i^;7v turn, I will Send you all dte, new^Jy can colletst. The dutcheSs is-lovely to a degree;* with child of her twentieth,iiand .h}w deed, not one of her daughters equaled her in beauty. She has Something extremely taking in her manners; a visible desire to pleaSe, and almost a certainty of obtaining that desire, ani-; mates her countenance. When , I view one in an exalted station, still more exalted by virtue, I gaze with , transport, and am reconciled to, and in humour wjth all the world.
I wish I could waft you here for a few moments, just to convince my-telf you are perfectly well. I know you would not deceive me in anVi point, but where my peace of mind is So strongly concerned; but I could
not

I am now in the country on a visit to an old lady, who was particularly kind to me. She tells me she is very near Seventy, and is the only remaining branch of a numerous family ; who have all paid the tribute of nature. I do affure you, she is in every reSpect younger than I aiit, since I cannot run up and down stairs with half her agility. Age has made no other alteration, than by a few traces on her forehead. She is extremely entertaining, has read much, and remembers all; is ex-C 2	tremely

tremely lively, and young people flock about her, and court her protection to their little Sports. I cannot think, that Site feels So. much as others; or perhaps, her heart has Suflered too much to bear more. She has experienced affliction, and yet is not troubled above meaSure. Calm resignation to the will of heaven, and an obliging temper may give rife to her content; be this as it may, site is a most agreeable woman, and if I am to be old, I wiSir to be exactly Mrs. W—.	A ne-
'phew of her’s, a Mr. B—, will Soon be of age, and on this occasion, we are to have great rejoycing; a ball for the ladies, Ihooting, drinking and rioting for the men. I cannot help wishing,■ once more, that you were among us, with a few others whom .	.	1 could

Your insinuation, as to your not being So happy, as I am willing to believe, has prevented me from reliShing my proSpect of felicity. The heart which does not feel the distreSs of a friend, is not worthy of existence.

Sir William Freemore is but just arrived from Italy, extremely genteel in his perfon, and has Something in-exprestibly gentle in his manners. I am happy you are not here, as I think you would be in danger of having a storm railed in your bolbm, which could not be allayed; as by what I can find - from Sir George« jocular manner to him, his heart is not in his own diSpoSal,	Sidney
is too gay, too much of a monkey in his drefs and manners; him you might See without the least emotion. Lord D—, is still the Same thought-C 4 -	leis

The gay Lady Harriet W-, graced our last ball with her preSence. She is very pretty, but not a little affeded ; don’t be angry with me for my Sen^ timents, nor Screw up your mouth as if I had been guilty of a fault j Surely I may give my opinion without Seeming ill-natured. Mr. Leverton was of her party. I pitied the poor man, for she really .did not Seem to mind him i Sir William took up all her attention.
Sir George Sidney leaves us for a few days to attend his sister to Bath.
He
'* A' No V E L.	22
.He .is a polite brother, Though his deportment on the whole is far from pleasing. I am called, LouiSa; a party on horSeback is propofed, the day too is So tempting, and the company, two beauxs, just imported, there is no resisting; but I stiall not Seal this, letter until my return.
Our party, by appointment, met at a delightful wilderneSs fix miles distant. But, LouiSa, you have no idek how differently the day turned out, from what we had expetsted; had you been in my place, I stiould have had moral reflections in plenty, but content yourSelf with the narrative I fend. We talked alamode for a stiort while, and were inSenfibly led to the Sweetest Spot imagination can paint; the men Said abundance of fine C 5	things,
34 E D W A R D.
\
things, and the women attempted to be clever. Whilst we two were thus engaged, cloSe to the rustick entrance, we heard the most diSmal groans that ever pierced a heart. ^Sir William, always ready to aflist, stew like lightning, direded by the Sound, and my horSe followed by instinct j the rest of the company did not Seem to attend to it, and we Soon lost fight of them; all this has So much the air of romance, that I am afraid you will hardly give me credit.
As a faithful historian I proceed, I fhall leave you to form what judgement you pleaSe on it; content to relate facts, without gaining belief.
We rode on without changing a word until Sir William dismounted, and was going to fasten his horfe to a
tree,
■A N o V E L.	35
tree, when perceiving me, “ ds it “ pofiible, my dear Lady Margaret, “ that you have forfook the com-“n pany, and Seek to be miSerable, for “ So .thole Sounds declare Some un-fortunate creature ?”
Perhaps we Shall be able to give relief to Some worthy perSon; if So, who can be more SelfiSli than we are ? I jumped off, and followed him iQto the thicket; and here, stretched on the grafs, lay a pale meagre fi-^ gure, whoSe head was Supported by a woman, and a little child lay shst a steep on her knees. She looked as if fhe Soon expected a period to her misfortunes. - A placid Smile fat on her lovely countenance, for So, my LouiSa, it really was, though clouded by adversity.

Thus much, however, is in my power, I will avoid the temptation, and absence may restore, what real worth has robbed me of.

The unthinking lady Harriet was for immediately opening the parcel and trunk, that we might know who the little urchin was. This fir William absolutely declared against, remarking, (hat it was of no Sort of conSequence who he was, Since if he knew'fihn to be the Son of a chimncy-Sweeper, nay even if his father was a murderer, he would nevertheless protedf the boy, and by So doing fulfil his engagement to the dying man.

Lady Ann is a very little woman, ex-tremly fat, and her face is one continued Scurvy-Spot; she has (I SuppoSe) attempted various cures, and tampered wish quack doctors, in order to remove this Scurf which covers her; and to make her fkin white and Smooth, has taken prescriptions, which instead of that, has made her infinitely more diSgusting. By way of atonement for want of beauty, she is So monstroufly E 3	affected.
78 E D W A R D.
affected; that no Venus of fifteen would be bearable, were Sire to uSc the tenth part of her airs. She was drest in white and silver, and never before did Such a bride grace the lists of Hvmen.
Lord Richard received me at the door, and careleSsly entreated me to Suffer him to introduce me to his adorable; affuring me, that he' looked upon this visit as an eternal obligation; he was by no means Sensible of this (to me) awful ceremony; hummed a tune after it was over; and taking me under his arm, left her ladyShip to amuSe herSelf during our abSence. To Say tlie truth, he will make a most fa-stiionable hushand, and her ladyship will not gain a companion by changing her state. Mrs, Darner is a most
excellent
A N. o V E I..	79
excellent, pld lady, and behaves to her niece with maternal afifedlion; She is So agreeable, So thoroughly entertaining, that I cannot Say how much wc all admire her: young people are fond of her becauSe She is indulgent to. them, and has not forgot Ihe has been young. Lady Harriet is now here, and I have been forced to Say more to her on the Subject of charity, than I ever did to any one in my life. Loverton follows her like a shadow, and she ufes
him like a dog. Lady ---------------has a
relation, miSs TouchWKDod, to Spend Some months with her : she has lately lost a brother, and gained an estate. She views every diSagreeable occurrence through a microScope, enlarging every uneasineSs, and dispersing then> among the whole company: no one can be thoroughly happy where she is: E 4	the

this friendly office, and I hope flie will Succeed. She has insisted on . having the care of my little Edmond for a few years,' and is to be the careful astistant of his growing reafon. I am in haste, my dear Clermont, but most faithfully

I have met with nothing but uneafineSs, and my mind is disturbed with disappointment; how is it postible in Such a Situation to think or write with care ? I am still in the country, nor am I in a hurry to return to Dublin; the noife and hurry of a city ill Suits my preSent mood, nor does the country give me much delight : So true it is, that nothing can give us joy, while the Soul is SurfSunded with SuSpence. I fear it is not in the power of trifles to alleviate my afflictions. Your character of fir William is rather partial.

Too Soon they are convinced, that realshappineSs is only to be obtained by virtue j and virtue has almost quitted the circles of the polite. To be polite, is to Say every thing which pleafes, never to utter a diSagreeable truth, but generally Spreads the cloak of distimulation on our words and ad ions; So, as when the Sighing Swain commences master of the fair one, we too frequently find his eyes are open.; every foible becoms a fault; mutual knowledge of each other, instead of indear-ing brings on indifference, and the lover is Sunk in the fashionable huf-band: they are Sorry they mistook each . others dispositions, and happineSs becomes a fairy dream.

the company we had this day at dinner. Lord Clownly is the only Son of a too indulgent mother j fhe has humoured him at the expence of her Senfe: he never in his life knew what it was ta be croffed 5 his education was quite under her eye, and fhe would not Suffer him to be corrected. The death of his father, early made him his own master 5 the first step he took was to turn ofFhis tutor, and purchaSe a large pack of hounds; his stable too was not neglected, and he commenced a Squire. Drinking too, as it'gave him a manly air, was cafily acquired y and when he is thoroughly in for it, all the inhabitants of his castle retire like rabbits into their holes j for he never yet was baulked. His fancy, Mr. Sporter, is an intimate friend of his, and knows how to continue So, by the

V SirThomas Markwell, Mr. Shootby, and a little Smart Mr. Swanton, with all the hounds, entered just as we were fitting down to dinner. Lady Clown-ly did not expect her Son So Soon, and if the truth was known, I fancy none of us wished for his lordship. A whole volley of oaths announced his entrance, by way of convincing us, that be had the finest Sport imaginable. “ But where is MerrylaSs ? she shall have the very finest bit, and Scamper too. Here, here, SoSs, SoSs ! ” A whole wing of a fowl, and a leg of a gooSe, were immediately tosted to the other fide of she

table, and’ fell in the lap of a very pretty girl, who could but ill afford the ruin of lutestring but just new. Our host only obServed, that stie Sat in the way, and bid her be very careful for the future. He then turned it off with a laugh, and whistling to the dogs. Sat down at the foot of the table. We now began our dinner j and Sporter commenced an information of his lordfhip’s adlivity; how lord Clownly had followed the hare; then praiSed his horfe, his dogs, and himfelf, which was ecchoed by the whole company. Bumpers Succeeded bumpers. Ah ! ladies, (Said Clownly) if you had Seen Merrylafs, when fhe first Seiz’d her ! O it was delightful 1 PuSs thought to eScape, but fhe kept alone to her; and then Scamper and V, lire together did her bufinefs. I will

L
Had lady Clownly Submitted to the advice of her friends, her Son had at this very instant been an ornament to-his country, and a blesting to his family; he is Sensible, good-natured^ and generous : he has parts, which if timely cultivated, would have been of infinite uSe to Society in general, and to-his friends in particular.
It

■lit is a great misfortune for women to have too much SenSe, that fort of SenSe which leads them to have a mean opinion of others; to defpife their hushands, and never consult them, abiding by their own wife determinations; believe their Sentiments on every Subjedl SuperiorTo all the world. A truce : I am Summoned. A fiddle is tuning ; and though I am not in a dancing humour, there is no poflibility of living for ourfelves alone : the world expeds compliance, and I must not offer to refufe.

Mr. Stanton was dear to me: I think on him with pleasure, and his friendship is a treafure I would not yield up on any account. But it is a long time since I have found out the real shock of my heart, with regard to him.

Sir William Freemore is greatly obliged to you ; though I do not believe either you intended it, or he is Sensible of the Service you have done him, In wishing me to Scrutinize into his temper and conduct: the more I obey you, the greater is my admiration and esteem. You Say true, that,matrimony admits of no medium ; ^and, if I ever venture to enter into that state, the man who receives my hand, must differ greatly from the generality of his Sex; he must have attractions to gain, and love to Secure my heart.

ThoSe who love by rule, might condemn me for being So honest. Others will wonder I don’t confine my heart, or Suffer it to love untill I am certain I am beloved.

torture in my fide, that I forgot every thing but mySelf. The Sun continued to Sliine ; but this lustre no more gladdened my heart, or pleaSed my eye: indeed the world was nothing to me ; 1 felt So much, that I imagined, it must be the final Separation of Soul and body; and when Such a Se* paration takes place, we forget every tiling in life. It was at this period, my dear P—, that all my errors flew before me, and I would have given millions-for thofe liours which I had wasted in the morning in idle conversation.

The History of L O U I S A.
Lord Henry L--was the third Son
of the duke of --. The duke
thought he perceived a growing genius in his Son, and knew no one more capable of cultivating it than Mr. Stammers, the tutor he had provided ; nor was he deceived. Mr. Stammers added to all the learning of a Scholar, the grace, eafe, and dignity of a gentleman. His father had always determined to give him a good education. Hia notions w^ere, that a good education
was
A Novel.	i 13
was Sufficient to bring a man of parts into the world, and to maintain him in it. Mr. Stammers, at the age of forty, was introduced to Lord Henry, who was then Seventeen : a SoStnefs of heart and a delicacy of feeling recommended him to his tutor ; their Souls were connected. After three years residence in England, after having travelled through it, and been thoroughly acquainted with the foil, laws, and constitution of his own country, lord Henry Set out with Mr. Stammers, to make what is called the grand tour. They had carefully attended to the manners and customs of every country through which they pasted, and it was the constant attention of Mr. Stammers to render folly ridiculous, and to gather all the Sweets of travel, without gathering the weeds of foppery.
Thus
U4 EDWARD.
Thus at the end of five years (when he received a Summons from the duke for that purpoSe) he returned with his pupil, and restored him to the arms -of his father, one of the .most finistied charaders which England could boast. Such .parts as his were not to remain inadive. At the age of -Seven and twenty ,(two years after his return) he was'difpatched on an embasty to Madrid, and Mr, Stammers rbecame his chaplain.
The uneafineSs which appeared in the countenance of poor Stammers, on his Sudden and unexpected order, made lord Henry recollect, that vthis was not a place he chofe to reside at, singe he had stiortgned his stay there when on his tour: but his curiosity was now raiSed, and he did all he
could

^■<tostld to Sift into the cauSe of a* cha-grine So visible; but his efforts met with no SucceSs. On Some pretence, he contrived to go before his lordSliip, and then on his arrival, he received him with quite another face: no fort of embarraflment aay longer appeared; All was peace and j(5y.
A .When the graceful Henry made -liis :pubiic .entry, crouds on crouds flocked to behold him. Amidst-thofe -Spectators there appeared one ffo lovely, that he could not help.eyding her with particular attention; She was about eighteen. Eve, as She is described by the inimitable Milton, could j-Hot have been more amiable: the iblulh of modesty, the animation of yii tue, of virtue in''her* most pleasing dbaffl ^'.'She .did not .Seem to attend iASAr	much
ii6 E D W A R D.
much to the pomp and parade which was passing, but on the contrary She kept her handkerchief to her face,
So that he only had one momentary view, before he was clofe to her.
Stammers had been abSent on a visit to a young gentleman who had been formerly under his care, and who, taking a liking to the country near Madrid, had reSolved to Spend a Summer there.. On his return he was ' astonished to hear his excellency rav-^ ing at the hateful restraint of greatnefs, and wishing to be at liberty to go in perSuit of the lovely creature he had Seen. He began a description of her, when he was interrupted by his own Servant, who came to inform him he had found the place of her abode. Lord Henry reSolved to pay her a

This woman was So pleafed with the interview, that fhe did not conceal any thing She knew. There are a number of Such animals in life, whofe whole pleafure consists in chattering. “ The young lady, my lord, is no daughter of mine, nor do I know who her parents are. She never stirs out, and I keep her always with me. I did venture indeed to take her to your lordstiip’s entry, for I love fights as well as any one, and as we are very Soon to return to England, I thought I might not have Such an opportunity again.

I wifhed to See all I could.” Lord Henry^ told her, fhe was perfediy right; and affured her he would not betray her to his chaplain: he then gave her a piece of gold, and bid her be careful of her charge, and promised to return Soon to See her.
Lord Henry on his return faithfully observed the SecreSy he promised ; but from that moment he felt himSelf leSs fond of his chaplain’s attendance. Distrust had crept into his bbSom, he regarded him as a favour’d

Her father was desired to try the efficacy of the Spa, and fhe was at that moment leaning on his arm: peace had long been a stranger to her boSom ; but this interview was too much; She fainted in his arms. “ Cruel Stammers, exclaimed lord Henry, (running to affist her father) you have undone us both.” She began to recover; and he could only articulate no more, and hurried from the Scene.
Lady Ann was at a little distance, and Saw the whole proceeding; She Saw her lord involved in melancholy ; ffie felt for him; She Soothed. He confessed his former attachment; he added, that pity hid the efFedl She perceived, for great was the havock

My father now turned all his thoughts to raiSe a fortune for his growing family. My grandfather had very little to bestow; his ambition was to gain Sufficient for the wants of nature. The luxuries of life, were not in his opinion worth the cares and the fatigues they always bring with • them.

Lord Travilton had long Subsisted on the ruin of others; he had dissipated his own fortune, and, like the devil, did all in his power to reduce thoSe, whoSe virtues were most talked of, to his own Shameful level.
Where is there a punishment So dreadful, as the return of reaSon to a mind depressed with conSciouSneSs of having brought miSery on thofe they most love.

The itch of gaming still continued, but he no longer postested the powers to gratify it. The marquis to whom he wrote, was in a high fever, and very Soon afterwards yielded his title, and fortune to Henry, leaving my father his guardian. He put Mr. Stammers’s name as a truScee, and if lord Henry would have ventured to take up money, he knew my grandfather would, not conSent to it in Such a cauSe. Thus situated, Travilton appeared, his purSe was full, and he ' offered my father an immenSe Sum for ever; on condition (yes Margaretta, the wretch did not blustr to make the offer) that my father stiould allow him the Same liberties which he took with my mother.

Should we add to our misfortunes by an unavailing Sorrow, which sinks us deeper instead of raising us from disticulties.
My poor father was perfedtly Sensible of all his errors, but by the constant, the never ceasing attention of my mother, he at last regained Some- ' thing like his former chearfulnefs.

Thus were we left expofed to the world, ,without the assisting hand of maternal fondneSs to encourage us in well-doing, cti* check us when we were going astray; it is true, we had one parent left, and it was that very parent, who brought up our mother to be the admiration of all who knew her: but life, at a certain period finds itSelf fatigued, and, like a wearied traveller, unable, at the cloSe of a long journey, to purSue another stage with

its wonted vigour. My grandfather had out-lived all thoSe dear coil-nedions which bind us to this world j •and though his strict notions of religion, did indeed prevent him. from grieving ill Such a manner, as to deprive him of his reaSon, yet, nevertheless, the whole univerSe became a void ; and a melancholy, which he exerted him-Self to overcome, stole inSenfibly upon him. Henry grew more and more in his favour; he was indeed, a most valuable young creature: it became neceffary that he Should return to England. With great regret it was, that my grandfather removed from a place, where every tree, walk, and flower, were-So many monuments of my mother : yet as he could Survive her loSs, he thought it behoved him to get the better of every other pain.
Harry

Harry was now Seventeen, and Richard twelve; no one of his years could be more advanced in learning; and his brother took great pains to in-strudt him. We removed to London, where my grandfather made enquiries after my father’s family, and found they were all in town. For our fakes he made a visit to his grace ; but when his name was told, the reception he met with was the most distrestlno: you can imagine.
The duke (paying no reverence to his facred fundion, nor to the dignity of a mind unfullied by vice) upbraided him, with having taken my father in by his arts, and forced him to marry his daughter. “ But you must contrive to nourish the little brats your-felf; for I never shall look upon them

He made no reply, but left the haughty duke to his own imaginations. For the two years we remained in town, I neither Saw nor heard from any one of my great relations j the duke kept his word. Harry was at Oxford, and Richard was his conftant companion.
They visited us Sometimes, and never were sisters happier in the friendship of their brothers than we were ; but Henry called the young one his peculiar charge. He told me, that he looked upon her, as the gift of one of the best of women, and that he . would protect her with his life. Nor was She to be conSoled at the Sepa-tion j though we did all in our power to amuSe her.

The accounts my grandfather received of the lad were So pleasing, as to have a most Surprizing effedl on his health. When it was thought proper for Harry to travel, he declared his intentions of accompanying him; • it was determined that Richard Should attend his brother, and that we Should go to France, and reside with a friend of our grandfather’s during their stay.
I must tell you that the duke (for I never will call him my unde) Sent to invite the marquis to dine with him before he left England.

He had careSully penetrated into their different charadlers, and found both had a fondnefs for women. Both were generous, and SuSceptible of lasting imprestions which virtuous attachments create in the breasts of their conquests.
Richard’s pastions, like a torrent, broke down every resistance. Harry’s,

The fViendSliip which bound them together, was founded on a basis which never fails of being lasting; and ,Harry reSolved to rife and Support Richard in the world.

Her daughter was about three years older than my sister ; she was lovelineSs in her most lovely form: her Son was just one and twenty, and if Harry had been abSent he would have appeared extremely well; for even in his preSence no one could paSs him by unnoticed.

De Charmes endeavoured to gain his friendship j but I observed Richard was by no means ready to comply with his desire ; he Seemed cautious of being intimate; and when he obServed our attachment, he became extremely unealy.
As we are apt to disapprove of thoSe Sentiments in others which differ from

^.sHarry obferved his brother’s behaviour "(indeed it was difficult for him to keep his real diflike within the bounds of good breeding) and inquired into the reaSon: Richard was very honest in his reply, and protested de Charmes was a designings fellow, and would be the means of making us all miSerable, unleSs we were upon our guard.

' I believe de Charmes contrived to make the youths jealous of each other. They mo longer meet with that good humour, that heart-felt astedlion, which So lately was their constant companion'; and when the time of Separation drew near, they parted/ with looks mutually exprestive of distrust.
Harry and the count left us at the Same time, attended by the faithful
Thomas,

Thomas, who had been hired by the marquis after the death of my grandfather, and had been lent to Richard at his departure for England. De Charmes was too polite not to offer his company, and the marquis Seemed ' happy at So pleasing an addition to the party. How dull did the returning hours Seem to us, which, but the day before, were crowned with mirth and felicity 5 We felt the weight of them.
The counteSs had an excellent library, to which we flew for redrefs., and but for that, our Spirits must: have Sunk under the distrefling change. It is true, we had frequent letters; Harry’s were affectionate, de Charmes entertaining 5 and the count penned numberlefs love epistles to my Sister.

I will not tire you with being toc> particular. Suffice it to Say, that two years were Spent in this manner, and at the end of the third, after a Silence from every individual, which cruelly allarmed us. Thomas appeared, ohis looks were disturbed, and it was wfith the utmost difficulty I could get him to articulate, that de Charmes had led his master into many difficulties. He had lost all his ready money, and mortgaged his estate to its full value, and all to dilcharge debts contracted at the gaming-table ; and, in a word, he had disappeared and not left any trace behind him to diScover the place of his retreat; the count had alSo involved himSelf.

To Colonel Clermont.-‘3’ct
Many thanks, my dear Edmond for the anxiety you> exprefs on my account. Lady Mar-garetta has made me happy by her conSent, and a few days will unite us for life. The more I am acquainted with her, the greater caufe is there for my admiration. Such Senfe, with' So much good, nature, cannot fail of rendering me all that your friend-fhip wishes.
Sidney has gained the affection of my lister, and you will easily believe, I gave my confent with fincere Satisfaction.

faction* But I long to have your opinion of my choice. You must not disappoint me5 you absolutely fhall not offer any excuSe. She too, the lovely Margaretta, expects you.
To Such a friend as you, I can^ unfold my heart, without fear of ridicule. You have been long e- -nough in the world to be able to> Set a true value on virtue. Tis a. jewel, Edmond, which cannot be rated; a commodity which the most Skilful artist cannot Sufficiently prize y happy is the man who has it in his poffeffion. How very different is it from the formality of a prude, and the caprice of a finished coquet.
You will Say, this is all very pretty at preSent, but before the year is
out,
N -	'
2ro8 E D W A R D.
out, you wUl find your fair one fink from her angelick height into a mere \voman, and will wish to be free once more.
Never, my dear Clermont; she is as free from art, as Eve first was. Nor need I be apprehensive of a tempter; her foul is as beautiful as her outward form is lovely; she is incapable of difguife. 1 write not with the enthufiastick description of a lover, but the cool deliberate fentiments of a friend ; and I shall live to See you change your ideas of the Sex, and hear you honestly confeSs, that, depraved as she world now is, yet there are not wanting enough of amiable women who merit our fondest attention.
-Sidney
A N O V E L.	209
Sidney affured me nothing could have made him give up the hope of lady Margaret’s hand, but her coldnefs, which convinced him he was not the happy man. ’Tis you, Freeman, who have obtained her heart; and to you I resign her. Your Sister will make me amends, and I think I fhall be full as happy as you. Then, and not till then, I told him of my long partiality in her favour, and received his thanks for what he called my noble behaviour ; after this I was at liberty to declare my pafiion. Had I betrayed the trust repoSed in me, though I had gained my wiSh, there would have been Such a mixture of wormwood in the draught, as to have made me lastingly wretched.
Guile
210 ED W-A R D.
Guilt renders Iris votaries miSerabk,. even in the very attainment of their purSuit. Not that I Should have been So romantic as to live fingle becauSe Sidney loved my fair one. Tmust have begged his pardon there j he would have Spoke ^ if (he refufed, 1 was then free, no friendship could deny me the Same advantage which others must enjoy. But to the point.
Determined to loSe no time, I was pleafed to hear a party propofed for the next day, in the fame delightful wildernefs which had afforded us the adventure I mentioned.
The day was fine, nature Smiled upon us, my Soul felt a Something which it is not in words to delineate,.

We found a few moments to our-Selves. Fairy dreams \vere a living picture of the Scene. I uSed no high-flown nonfenfe to deScribe the reality of my affection ; honestly 1 told her how long, and how thoroughly I loved, and alfo my reafon for having kept it a Secret from her.
She heard me with the utmost attention, and then as frankly declared her foul above the low arts too common to the fex •, afTuring me She preferred me to all the men she had ever Icen 5 that she had long approved of mej and, finally, that she accepted of my vows with the Same pleaSure that she would resign her hand,

felt. She is truly delicate .in all her adions, and all her words and looks, but Scorns to be fettered with constraint, when (he wishes to confer-a favour on the man who is Soon to be her hushand.
I receive the bkshngs of providence without torturing mySelf as to the eyents of futurity, and am grateful for the favours, which I daily obtain from heaven*
Thus, Edmond, you have a profpect of matrimonial felicity. Come, therefore, to Freemorc Dale, and be convinced that there are Some Roman Spirits still existing, who dare be Singularly virtuous.

I WRITE to my dear Wharton, from the feat of our friend fir William Freemore, where I have been this whole Summer, and it is but justice to that matrimonial state which I So lately deSpiled, that A 3	I
6 EDWARD.
^I now am prompted to give you a circumstantial description of the inhabitants of this pleasing dale.
Lady Margaret is formed to pleash 5 affability and good-nature are the lures fhe employs; and though her face may attract, her Soul beams through and gives a lasting luster to her charms. Home is the female theatre for action; it is there alone we can be certain of merit. That . woman who wifhes to gain conquests in a croud, cannot be certain of her prize : it is true, {he may Sometimes , ib far Succeed as to captivate the heart of an inexperienced youth; but she can never imagine that a Sensible man will trust his hopes of domestic felicity in the hands of a distipated woman,
, whpfe
o V E l;	^^7
viriiafc whole joy is centered^Tn' a croud.
Lady Margaret is attentive to her fiushhnd, — becauSe Slie lores him. And I do believe, that where there is a sincere affection, it is impossible not to be attentive. I had been uSed sto See mutual indifiSerence reign in the actions of hushand and wife ^ I had obServed, that variety constituted their ideas of love; and that they ceaSed to put on the appearance of it as Soon as that effential zest ceaSed to give the only charm in a word, I had Seen fo much of the world, as to consider Hymen as the plague of poor mortals. View me now an abSolute convert, listening with heart-felt pleaSure to the adoring hushand, who never is So happy as when repeating the numberleSs per-A 4	Sections
8 EDWARD.
f^^jpns of an amiable wifert See them united in bonds which muff, eiv creaSej for love founded on esteem^ will last for ever.
We pafs our time in the most pleasing, becaufe the most rational manner. If the day permits, we walk after breakfast in a beautiful wjl-derneSs of Iweets, or in the fields, garr dens and walks,, with which this place abounds. Our fair companion dcferts us for an hour, or So, and returns to manage her houstiold affairs^ and we confole ourSelves by Some amuSement, either bowls^ billiards, or cricket, or going about the ground vvith our guns: when we are Sufficiently fatigued with our exercife, we return to the houSe in Search of lady Margaret, and always find her ele- I
gantly |
A ‘'Nte vET.^'^	9
gafitly neat,' employed in Some’ work which does justice to her -fancy, -and fir William and I then relieve one another in reading history or poetry.
We did expect an addition' to Our fbciety, by the arrival of a lady^' who lady .Margaret Freemore calls her friend, and in whofe praiSe She is very eloquent; but stre is not come. The houfe is Seldom without company, but I like it best with the Set n6w in it, which is an aunt of her ladyShip’s, fir William, and mySeif. I was obliged to leave you, and have ever since had too much on my mind to be able to finifh my letter.
Captain Bolder is here; fir William knew him Some time ao-o at
O
Bristol, and he has thought proper to A 5	renew
16 E D W A R D.
renew that acquaintance; he is in; the guards; a tall young fellow, rather handSome than otherways, and though stiff in his air, Seems very well qualified topuSh himSelf into life.— Pray do you know him ? I think you must, a's he is in the fame regiment with your brother. From him, you may at least be able to enter particularly into the character of this our visitor.
Forgive me, if I confeSs I am apt to fuSpect when I find a man So very assiduous as Bolder: never did any one take So much pains to gain the confidence of a man without Some ■ sinister view, and I fear his attempt to ingratiate himfelf into the opinion of fir William will not be fruitleSs; nor is he lefs attentive to lady Margaret: he has fifty new tricks, two hundred |
and
A N o V E t.	1 r
'kfid nihety-nine tales" of Scandal. I roasted lady S -----, and he imme-
diately informed us that fir Thomas Lurcher was thought very deep in her good graces, and that it Vv^as fuSpedfed they very frequently met at a certain perfumer’s, where they conSulted how to make beautifying washes with great
SucceSs. Lord S-----, continued he,
is too much engaged with the fair Italian to mind what they do.
He generally is of fir William’s opinion in most things, and when he does differ, he contrives to be brought about by the strength of his arguments. How insinuating is flattery, when we can Suck it down from the hands we deSpiSe; it is as penetrating as honey, and too frequently as pleasing to the palate .i*
A 6	What
It E D W A R D.
What could induce this fellow to disturb us, as, Oh ! Harry, we were happy till he came ? ” Freemore is thoughtful and plodding, nor does the company of his lovely wife Seem to give him the Same joy as formerly.
By my Soul, I could almcct find in my heart to Send this fellow a very long journey for his intrusion.
I have been a long time between the beginning and ending of this letter.
My mind is in a very uneaSy state.
What does not poor lady Margaret feel from this change in her hushand ? It must be my care to bring every thing to its primitive order. Adieu.

From the Same to the Same.
I Am at a lost how to account for your silence, as I was So pressing to hear from you as Soon as possible, and as yet I have no anSwer; but as you are not apt to treat a friend in a flighting inattentive manner, I arn inclined to believe you have Some business on your hands, which per force denies me the Satisfadlion I requested.
Bolder is still here ; he Seems to like his quarters So well as to have no thoughts of marching Suddenly. Lady Margaret has not been very well 5 Something preys upon her mind. I fear it is difficult to meet happineSs in the married state. This lovely woman
has
14 EDWARD.
has all that Sensibility'of foul, all that gentlenefs of manner with which Milton describes our first parent, nay,
I do from my heart believe her Soul is as lovely as her outward form; and yet in Spite of all her numberlefs pcr-fedions sir William now negleds her, and is making preparations for reviving an old title which had originally belonged to his family.
This Bolder has found out that ambition is his master-Spring, and moves him at his pleaSure. Young men are too fond of Settling in life before they really know themSelves : love gets the better of every other thought, and they too late diScover their natural bent. "
Lady Margaret had fondly imagined that her hushand would never exchange
A No V £ L. ^	15
change the quiet, for the bufy multuous Scenes which diffipation prefent. She had encouraged the delusion, until She is necesiSitated to roufe herSelf from her dream, and doze no more inhappineSs ; for Bolder has convinced her, that mifery is more or leSs the portion of mankind.
Her amuSements take their rish from the first dawn of reaSon in the mind of the blooming little Edward* Sir William is very fond of his young charge, and I am certain intends fulfilling his engagements to his dying father. He has got a worthy young fellow to Superintend him, whole education was Such as renders him an able instrudton. He had been at the fame School with fir William, and had alSo partaken of the fame advantage at the univerlity.
His

His uncle had always intended him for his heir, adding learning to grace the fortune he designed to give him; but he was Suddenly Snatched off, ^ and a will produced which cut poor Frank Worthy off with a Shilling, and gave the estate to a very distant relation.
Freemore heard of the affair, and has ever since provided for him in the handSomest manner; nor does he feel dependance in any other manner than what gratitude teaches. But lady Margaret has lost the paper which was hereafter to have informed her of the birth, and the whole occasion of Edward’s misfortunes ; and what adds tc> her distreSs is, that his aunt still continues infensible to every thing about her. 1 incloSe you a letter from sir William to me, which will let you
into
m0
A Novel.	17
into all I know of the adventure > and I am certain from my knowledge of your good-nature, you will feel your-Self much interested in the future conduct of this little urchin.
Lady Margaret adds her affistance to Mr. Worthy, and he is between them both early instructed in the art of thinking. If ever I marry, it must be with Such a woman as this 3 nay, I protest, if I knew where to find one who reSembles lady Margaret, I would this moment pay her my real addrestes, and gladly become a benedict for the Sake of her fociety. But to what pur* poSe theSe wishes ? I never caa expect to be happy.
Sir George and lady Sidney are Soon expected here, and Bolder is to leave
us
/
-iS E,;:.D W'A R D.
us for a week; a letter which he^ft-ceived lately, renders his departure necessary. Sir William was not only much against his going, but absolutely infisted upon his Speedy return,
- I can easily perceive that lady Margaret does not rejoice in the idea of his being So much favoured by sir William, He is by no means that fort of man whom I could have fup-pofed would have gained the esteem of Freemore j pert and empty, with an immenfe fund of Small talk and idle anecdotes. He has, it is true, been very much with people of faShion, and he is fo much all things to all men, that no doubt he finds a pleasing reception every where : but if my poor inSatuated friend does not repent the confidence with which he honours
hiin
A Novel. 19
him at preSent, I Ihall give up all my . fkill in physiognomy.
Lady Margaret daily incrcaSes in her fize, and this event will, I Tope, make her thoughtlefs hushand reflect on her danger, and pay more attention to his situation. If he does not, I fliall really have very little to Say to him hereafter.

Lord Belville made him very welcome to his houSe. He had been uSe-ful to his lordShip in promoting his pleasures. Numbers of women were procured for him by the afliduity of this fon of Mars; but at this time lord Belville had an affair on his hands which required his most faithful attention. He had been married t© a young lady of quality ; She was (as is too much the custom) taken from the murSery to figure at the head of his lordship’s table. The dear proSpect of becoming her own mif-trefs, of going where Ihe pleaSed, ordering what She ehoSe, Shining at the opera, Almack% and of even leading the fashions, were inducements too
great
24 E D W A R D.
gi*eat to be withstood. She yielded her hand therefore to the diSpoSal of her pappa, and, too late for her repofe, became convinced, that fine diamonds, fine horfes, and all the etceteras of greatnefs, have it not in their power to give felicity to their owners.
Lord Belville had no idea of love. Interest made him conSent to the marriage. Lady Belville was young and thoughtlefs ; fhe Saw very little of her lord, but was not uneafy by his ne-gledl. Bolder visited as uSual, and was as uSual of Service to his lordfhip. The duke of M---------became a con-
stant attendant on the young lady, and would often curfe his stars which did not permit him to fee her first. Crouds of flatterers condoled with her on her being thrown away, and

Thus Surrounded, it was impoflible to be as young, as lovely, and as un-practiSed in the art of deceit, and not like her have thoroughly deSpiSed the man who left her for other women, far iefs lovely.
' Lord Belville had been disappointed in the views he had formed, which, joined to the little regard he had for his wife, operated So powerfully as to make him heartily wiSh he could get rid of his wife; and the croud of young fellows, who daily furrounded her, made him conceive it would be no hard matter to become thoroughly free,

The world, my dear Clermont, is too apt to dignify people who have not one virtue to recommend them. The art of pleasing in company is fo easily attained by artful and designing men, that it is often found they are too Successful in their attempts on the most amiable, and the most worthy; and it is only a certain Set of men, who, like Bolder, become neceffary, that are most approved of by the noiSy throng.

Behold your danger, therefore, and remember, that the only way to avoid temptation, is to stiun the tempter.

But did they know how difficult Such an undertaking was, they would as Scon jump into the fire, to Save a trifling toy, as venture for life with Such a man. Thofe women would make good catholicks, for great is their faith. However, lady Sidney, in Spite of her giddinefs, is to be pitied. Now I Suppofe you will think me in danger by the confeffion: no matter,
I can stand it; nay, I can even laugh at your idle fears. Lady Margaret is — as we could wiSh, as is the

You will kindly call it my misfortune, but I protest it is my fault, and I never could valuemySelf were lable to endure the notion. Heines in romance aN ways make excufes, and lay the blame On the great, the matchlefs beauty of the lady; while I readily give it under my hand, that if any other cauSe, than a sincere esteem, occafioned my anxiety for the welfare of the amiable lady Margaret, there could not be found a greater villain than

Sir George and lady Sidney carne^ here time enough for the christening, of my little cherub. The affedlion my Freemore has for this sister, cannot fail of endearing her to me; but what Shall I Say to her choice, my LouiSa ? AlaSs I I fear long before thiS’ time She has very Severely repented of it, for fir George is not the object who could create a lasting affection. Let me turn with Satisfaction to his op-pofite. Colonel Clermont has been here fome months; his converfati* on is pleastng, and we cannot help being improved by it. He is the cho-ten fiiend of my fir William^ and as fuch I rejoiced in his arrival ; my te*r gard for him is fuch,. that I could really wijh he was united to my Lou-ifa.

Edward is very Soon to Set off for Westminster •, fir William cannot think of giving him a private education; if he is of confequence in life, and his fortune is to be great, that will enable him to make a figure .; and if it is necestary for him to gain his bread by his merit, this is the School which will raife him to every noble action. I foel much stom the thoughts of lofing him ; but it is for his advantage, and I ought to be content. Mr. Worthy is to attend him as a private tutor, and no expence is

What astoniShes me is, that lady Sidney gives herSelf very little trouble about him; but this af-fedfed indifference (foraffedted I hope it is) is I fuppoSe her method of reclaiming him.

He is gonej sir William has accompany’d him, and gives him into the care of the masters. Colonel Clermont does every thing in his power to remove my anxious fears about him; he has taken this journey at this time on pur-pofe to do what he can to amuSe. Lady D^------- informs me, that Ed-

Sir George Sidney is with fir William, and brought his lady here, as they were to be abSent for Some weeks, lo that her ladyship and Clermont are my companions. We paSs part of every day in the nurSery, for it is my principal care that the first impreffions may be good. I remember to have heard a very wife man Say, that the nurSery was the hot-bed of evil; that not one vice in the whole catalogue of fin, but what first took their rife from thence. Revenge is early imprinted; by beating the ground on VoL. II. D	which

Avarice —by not fufifering the favourite to be deprived of any thing that is his by another child j and the love of authority, by gaining whatever it demands by crying. Thus are the paffions indulged, and it is next to an impoffibility to conquer and eradicate what has been So carefully implanted, and which has taken Such deep root. It is my care therefore to fee that none of the above happens. My fervants are informed, (and they find me reSoiute) that if they indulge her, they will lofe their place. I will trot Suffer her to obtain any thing by crying for it; but though I am cautious, yet i make a great difference between humouring, and wantonly croffing; to

Lady Rakewell called me away. She came to pay me a visit in the abSence of my hushand—Gothic word, but fit for a woman in a nurSery.

Edward was moved, the tears ran down his face, he kiffed the little animal, and in-treated him to be friends with him. He would have gone on his knees to be forgiven—told him he was his own Edward — nor was this all, lady D—-could not Separate them thatevening; he shared his Supper with his little companion, and then took him into his own bed. He would not tell a lie to Save himSelf any punishment, but nothing could prevail on him to give up his friend.

LETTER X.
The History of Kelan, encloSed in a letter to lady Margaret Freemore, from Louisa.
Kelan, the Son of Celander, had been early brought up in all the paths of virtue: he had been taught that to be happy, was to be
innocent.
A N O V E L.	85
innocent, and that wiSdom was tlic <iik choicest gift of heaven. Celander knew that paSIions unSubdued precipitated their poffestbrs into evil; it was therefore his wifii, that Kelan might become master of himSelf; that he might revere that power which plentifully bestows his blessings, whoSe mercy extends to all his creatures, who pities our infirmities, who listens to our complaints, and kindly relieves our necessities, and at last receives our parting breath, and wafts us into the regions of eternal bliSs.
“ There is not. Said Celander, a misfortune which has power to afflitst us, but which vanishes before us, if we look up stedfastly to our God, —to Him, without whofe permiffion nothing can affect us, and whofe ways are far
beyond
86 EDWARD.
beyond our shallow comprehension. But while we look up, let us not dare to accuSe; let us bend with fubmiffi-on to the Almighty, and only afk for strength to be able to bear his holy dispensations. Believe me, my Son, there is nothing impostible to him who made the heavens, and who laid the foundations of the world; he knows our thoughts, and we can do nothing which is hid from him. Nor does this mighty King of Kings regard us with the Severity of a tyrant,' but with the fondnefs of a father. The fountain of love cannot hate thofe whom he has made, neither could he create us but with the view of our future endlefs peace. Think of this, my Son ; let my words sink deep into your heart, and when you are affailed by the powers of dark-
neSs,
A Novel. 87
liefs, look back with care on your own adlions, view them with atten* tion and impartiality, and you will find that you have invited him to you by Some unguarded footsteps. Above all, be careful not to force the inward light to Shine no more, Let this faithful monitor prevail; silence not that guard which God has placed in your boSom, and which will tell you whenever you do wrong.”
Kelan heard with attention, and his mind was equal to the taSk which his father had given him. His reflections raiSed Some difficulties — he looked with astonilhment at himSelf— he moved his fingers, and was not able to comprehend how he was able to perform the motions. He Spoke, iior could he imagine how he did
So.
88 E D W A R D.
So. HorSes, dogs, the birds of the air, the finny tribe, lived and moved, but they were given to man for his uSe — man, therefore, of all the works of wonder, was the greatest.
Surely (Said he) there must be Some reaSon for this deference; man is to live hereafter ; he is to exist when all things elSe are done away.”
Celander faw with pleaSure the advancement which Kelan made in every branch of knowledge. He led him imperceptibly on into the deepest enquiries. But while he poured forth instrudion, while his converfa-tion improved and delighted him, it was his chief care not to harden his heart against the woes of his fellow , creatures. Nor did he think it at all lieceffary to forewarn him of the arts
which
A Novel. ^ Sg
which Some men pradice to deceive the open unSuSpeding heart. He thought his own experience would at last defend him, and he took care to implant Such principles as should inSure his virtue.
Thus Kelan grew, — justice and ' honour were his chief charaderisticks, nor did the generous Ceiander Suffer any fears to invade his chearful bo-ibm. The idea that his Son would be happy hereafter, made him care-leSs as to the troubles of this life. They studied nature — the transformation from the crawling inSed, to the lively butterfly, afforded the certainty of the reSurredion. “ ObServe,
~ my Son, this little creature ; view the pains which it takes to entomb itSelf; in this you view the finger of your
God,—
/
90 E D W A R D.
God,— a very little time and k Sh^l ceaSe to move. Look here, this very fly, with wide extended wings, was once just Such a worm. If this .animal comes thus again to life, what fhall not we do, who are Such favourites with the All-wife. We have a free v/ill of our own, and if we chofe evil, and flight good, we must abide the confequence, and dreadful will diat be.” The voice of wiSdom was pleasing to the ears of Kelan,— his foul was capable of receiving the happinefs wlilch benevolence infpires, his hands v/ere open as his heart, the tears of afflidion were wiped away, and wherever he went he feemed to difpenfe felicity. A calm ferene joy brightened his countenance. As yet he had not left his father’s houfe, nor did he feel any the least defire to
quit
A N O V E L.	9I
quit that most delightful Scene. The frefh blown flowers bestowed their fragrance on him; for him the Sweet melody of the birds Seemed to re-found through all the woods and groves. He became their protector, and no one dare molest their little offspring; they grew tame by his attention, and numbers of them would hop about him. He frequently threw himSelf on the moffey bank, and observed the beauties of nature in her most lovely habitation. He never as yet had known affliction, for as yet he never had done any action which his heart condemned. He had a linnet which he reared himSelf, and to whom he had offered liberty, but the little warbler choSe to remain with his indulgent master. He eat out of his hand, rested on his head, and very
often
92 E D W A R D.
often rested in his boSom. He felt the power which gratitude has over good minds, for he Soon became So fond of the lively Songster, that it gave him pain if he did not accompany him in all his excursions.
One morning, in that feafon of the year when every child of nature Sheds all their Sweets, and all their bounties, on the Sons of men, Ke-lan awoke, and hurried out to view the charms of the morning, to See the Sun appear in all his Splendour, and to join his Songs of praiSe to-the great author of his being. Nor did he forget his bird. (Such was the first state of man, unknowing thoSe evils which are now our common lot, and which, until fin first came, was a stranger to the breast
of
A N o V E L.	9^
of Adam. O innocence! how pleasing is thy form, how delightful is the Sound of thy harmonious voice ! Thofe Vv^ho beheld Kelan with his linnet, who Saw his heart expand with rapture, might have a taste of heaven.) He looked about him with wonder; new beauties aroSe to his view, and his gratitude poured forth the everstowing of his bofom in an hymn of praife. He finistied his adoration, and then began to play with his little companion. He fang to him, and Kelan gave him another in return; and now the little creature ventured to take a Short flight, under the shade of an aged oak, where the happy Kelan fat. The branches Spread over him, and their verdure, fresh with the morning dew, gave an odour the most refreshing. Here the
little
94 EDWARD.
little wanton hopped and Sldppedj and gave Some musical chirps. Kelan. took out his flagelet and began a little air. Celander had given him a taste for music, or rather the harmony of his foul was Such as inspired him with it. But the cry of dif-trefs rouzed him, and he instantly got up : it was his favourite, in the tallons of a hawk. He was enraged, the danger of his friend hurried him into pastion. The pole which he always took with him to aid him in his leaps over a little rivulet, now gave him Some astist-ance, and his own activity Soon made him master of the topmost branch. The hawk Saw his approach ; the pole which almost touched him, gave the allaim; he stew for fafety, he stew, but dropped his prey. Alas!
it
A N 0 V E L.	95
it was too late — the little warbler was deprived of motion, and Kelan lost his friend, the gay companion of his happy hours. At first, the desire of revenge prevented him from feeling how much he regretted the death of his linnet. He would have killed the hawk, he determined to perSue him, but had not gone far before he Saw how vain Such an attempt would be ; he then returned, and taking up his bird, looked upon it with an eye of pity. The tears distilled in quantities, his voice was not able to articulate, the rising Sob almost choaked him, and he could not help recounting all the numberleis perfedfions of his departed friend, his mind recolledted all the various accomplishments of the little creature. At last he broke forth—Have you, then, left me, you
pretty
. o6 EDWARD.
if
pretty innocent ? No more shall Ke-lan listen to thy melody, no more shall his grateful hand Supply thy ne-cefifaries, or deck thy cage with new blown roSes; but you are gone, and all my complaints are lost in air. He was silent, he was lost in thought. The Same hawk, or just Such another, returned to the fame tree, but he had now no longer even a wish to hurt him. Revenge dwells not long in w^orthy minds. ReaSon reSumed her feat, and restedion convinced him, that in destroying his linnet, the hawk only perSued his prey, and that he had no right to murder him. He lamented his loSs, but was pleaSed he had not been able to devour his favorite and he thought that a Sufficient punishment. But when he Saw him destroy a whole nest, which he had
considered
A N 0 V E L.	97
considered as his peculiar charge, he reSolved to defend the rest of his litr tie tenants, and by Shooting their enemy, restored peace to the grove.
But it was time for Kelan to mingle among men, and Celander reSolved to fend him to London. He had a careful Servant, whoSe life had known misfortune, and who had at last met with an astylum under his hofpitable roof. To his care he intrusted his Son, and to him he gave this charge; “ Consider Kelan as your own, permit the goodneSs of his heart to exer-cife itSelf, and never let the want of fortune distrefs him; mine is Sufficient to allow him the comfort of healing the wounds of poverty. If you caution him against the villanies of mankind, it may Shut up his com-

pafiion, and nip his virtues in the bud. Attend him as his friend, let not harfh rebukes deprive you of his confidence. The time of thy Servitude is over; be to Kelan in the place of Celander, and give him an opportunity of viewing all the conditions of men. Stint not his generosity, permit it to expand. I Shall consider riches as a curSe, if the foul of Ke-ian was to be Sordid. If we Supply ethers, the king of heaven will Supply us. ”
Manfred heard, and reSolved most faithfully to obServe the instructions of Celander. Every thing was in readinefs, .and the next day was to deprive Relan of the company of his ither. All his youthful joys were un to vanish, , but the reflection that
the
A Nov E L.'	99
the best of friends, whoSe experience and Superioui* wiSdom must know best what was most proper for him, in Sorne degree calmed his heart, and he determined to Submit without murmuring. He got up early, and stole to the tree where he had So often fat; he looked upon every flower as an in* timate, of whom it was necessSary to take leave. Not one single blade of grafsj but was dear to him. The river, the little Shrubs, all were his friends, and he felt himfelf afflided at the feparation. He plucked Some most, and wrote his name upon the tree 5 thought of his linnet, and the thought gave him pain. Under his name he marked thefe words, “ Ke-lan lamented the death of his linnet, he never knew till that moment what afflidion was 5 this therefore is to E 2	Serve
loo EDWARD.
Serve as a monument of his gratitude to that power, who had fo long pro-
te<5ted him from misfortune.”-- He
dropped Some tears. —(Who ever deS-piSes this diScription, has a heart incapable of the feelings of innocence, and hardly merits this introdudion to the amiable Kelan.) In this employment Celander found him; his parental heart expanded with delightful Senfations, and exulted in the virtue of his Son, and the pleasing emotion brought tears into his eyes. “ O Kelan I my beloved child, may the Almighty p re Serve you. Believe me you will never know what misfortune is, while your conscience does not condemn you. Remember, Kelan, no miSery is So great, no torture So intollerable, as an invv^ard tormentor, from whom it is impossible to sty. I could not have
brought
A N O V E L. 101
brought mySelf to part with you, untill I thought you were Sufficiently strong to relist temptation. Eternal vengeance will overtake you, if you depart from the precepts which I have endeavoured to instill into you. Go then, my Son, and my prayers Shall warmly aScend for your perSeverence in well-doing.. ”
Kelan was not able to bear his affiidlion for the first day. The death of his bird lost its strength, when compared to this; and Manfred could only give him comfort, by ffiaring in his trouble. But time weakens our feelings, or we should be most wretched. Kelan was.made for friendOiip. Celander had wrote to a gentleman in town, and had entreated him to affist his Son in the practice of virtue:;
E 3	and
102 E D W" A R D.
and the resistance of temptation.

Celander had been So long out of the world, ^hat he was almost as great a stranger to it, as his fon, or he never would have pitched upon Mr. Varnifh for the guide and protector of his Kelan.

VarniSh could not have wished for a tool more fit that Kelan : he was amazed how he could be So ignorant, and in his heart he deSpiSed Celan-der, though he pretended to esteem him. He bid the strangers welcome, (and never was any perSon more So.) it was the wish of Varnish, that Ke-Ian might have no SuSpicion ; and aa he v/as w^ell practised in deceit, it was not difficult to affume a character ioreign to his heart. This, however, was a harder part than he imagined. Kelan did not want SenSe, and his benevolence made him univerSally beloved. Manfred alSo was a bar, which

VarniSh knew not how to overcome. His attachment to Cdander, and his love for Kelan, left him no hopes that bribes could prevail. The bountifute hand of the former left him nothing to wish, and the latter added more. VarniSh at last determined to deceive both. The natural honesty of Manfred rendered him. lefs on his guard than another might have been ; but he had lived So long, in the world, as to have gained So much experience as to know, that they wound Surely who wear the appearance of friendship.

he took in thinking that his actions r r were Such as Celander would approve, ? made him listen with pleaSure to the praiSes of VarniSh and Manfred felt ' a pleaSure, not to be deScribed, when he was praiSed for the diligence with which he attended to Kelan, Grave and improving authors made the hours pafs imperceptibly. As yet the cunning guardian had not ventured to introduce his ward into the gay, Seducing croud of thoughtlefs men, who had quite banistied that intruder conscience from their habitations, and in its place were governed ' by distipation, and all the dreadful train of gratified pastions. He knew, that the mind long habituated to tread in the paths of rectitude, would not be easily brought to forSake her. He tried every method to weaken his

confidence in himSeif, and to prcr vent him from taking delight in his own approbation; but all to no purpoSe, Manfred, from day to day, read lectures upon that Subjetst, and he had more Sway than VarniSh* Vice appeared even amidst his artful blan-difhments, and virtue did not loSe her dignity in rags. VarniSh began to deSpair-—he could not find him Sufficiently weak to hope for SucceSs; but he Soon found that Kelan had not as yet felt the power of love. He had Seen a young creature in one of the streets, opprefied with Severe distreSs, following by an old man, who Seemed in the hands of opprefiion. She attempted to move them to compaffion, but it was not in her power; and since fhe could not lave him from a priSon, (he reSolved to accompany him to it.
Kelan

Kelan enquired the cauSe,—and found that he was guilty of being poor, — that he had nothing but his liberty, and his creditors thought fit to deprive him of it, since he could not SatisSy their demands. His indignation roSe ; and while he abhorred their cruelty, who could treat their brother in shch a manner; yet for the old man’s Sake, or . rather for his daughter’s, or for both, he gave their torn hearts all their desire, and Sent the poor man in peace to his former houSe. As yet he had not given the least attention to the face and figure of Maria. He felt the pleaSure of having had it in his ■power to restore joy to their drooping hearts, and he did not wiSh for more. At last he began to consider, that it was to no purpoSe that he Saved them from one difficulty, if they were to be
involved
A Nov E Lr	109
involved in a greater, by not having the means of fubfistance, and he re-folved to go with Manfred to the calm abode. The old man was thankful without parade ; he adted as if charity was no stranger to his bofom, and his manner gave great fatisfadlion to the breast of Kelan. Mr. Lorenzo Sent for Maria, —She was preparing a Small repast for her much loved father.— Her face was Sweetly expreflive of gratitude, and She Seemed lovely in the eyes of Kelan;—and he Soon found, that virtue is a loadftone that draws her votaries together. He did not know what was the matter with him, —— his tongue no longer performed its office; — hesitation and diffidence now took' place, and he was ;io longer master of him Self. Lorenzo presented his child to the generous

Lorenzo and Maria have nothing elSe to give.’’ Kelan bowed, felt foolilh, and with a promise of calling the next day, departed; but left Sufficient with Lorenzo to make his future days as eafy as he could wiffi.
Manfred
A N 0 V E L. pr I.
Manfred watched with attention, and the Soul of Kelan stood open to his view. He Saw the imprestion, which the beauty of Maria had made on his heart, and dreaded the conSe-quence. Celander, he imagined, would object to his So'Soon fettling in life; and he had reaSon to believe, that Kelan never would wiSh to heal a wound with a plaister of poiSon. Manfred determined to trust VarniSh with the Secret, and to gain him over to his way of thinking, which was to Conceal Maria from the eyes of Kelan. VarniSh heard with concealed fatisfaction the whole story. He now looked upon him as his own, and re-folved to act a double part; to agree with Manfred, and to gratify Kelan. To the former he propoSed fettling fomething handfome on Lorenzo,
and
tiz EDWARD.
and charging him, as he valued the innocence of his Maria, to conceal her from the eyes of Kelan. But to; Kelan he betrayed the confidence re-pofed in him, and offered to aflist him-in any thing he would chuSe to undertake ; bidding him be Speedy in the resolution he might form-, least Manfred might prevent him, and render all his Searches after her, vain and fruitless. Kelan was for flying into the prefence of Manfred, and insisting on his informing him, why he acted fo baSe a part, as to wiSh to deprive him of what he held fo dear. But Varnisti held him to the promiSe he had made of never communicating what he was going to tell him. He confented, ' and even condeScended to employ art. VarniSh was therefore to perSuade the old Lorenzo to
remove ^
A Novel. i|3
remove; Manfred was to be a stranger to their new dwelling, and Kelan was to enjoy her company without interruption. But as he had been guilty of SuSpeding the man on whom his father charged him to rely, he Sunk still lower by striving to excuSe him-Self, and lay all the blame on him*
Thus eafy is the transition from virtue to vice, step by step, until our peace is lost, that peace which gives charms to every thing we fee. He was but a young beginner; one concealment brought on another; and ' . the. virtuous Kelan had Secrets which he hid from Manfred. He no longer beheld him with the- Same eye of complacency ; a melancholly over-fpread his countenance, and his foul was tortured with the perfidy (as he
thought
II4 EDWARD.
thought it) of Manfred. Manfred beheld the change, and attributed it to the absence of Maria. He did not ehufe to afk too many questions, least Kelan might SuSpedt him F and Var-nifh had quieted his fears by affuring^ him, that he had removed licr to Such a distance, that it could not be in his> power to find her,
Ealy is the gradation, but alas! ^Is next to an impofiibility to return from vice to virtue. Oh ye unthinking ! let this warn you how yoy give up a long tried friend, untill ye are thoroughly convinced he is no longer w’orthy of our regard. VarniSh had gained a great point, and had left Kelan no other dependance than him-Selfj, and he began to think him a most pleasing companion, and wondered

VarniSh. had prevailed on Lorenza to remove. He told him that the young gentleman had provided fit ap-^ partments to receive him, and that, he was a man of Such uncommon honour, that he might venture to trqst him with the lovely Maria. The place he provided was in the houfe of a creature of bis own, whom he could command to do whatever he choSe.. He amuSed Lorenzo with informing him, that Kelan had thoughts of Setting him up in the Same extenfive bufineSs, which his ‘misfortunes had forced him to^ give

over; and he adviSed him not to Seem as if he had any doubt of the worthy, the noble minded Kelan, Lorenzo had So much generosity of foul as rendered him leSs fearful of the Snares which the designing: often spread. His openneSs had plunged him into difficulties; no wonder then if the idea of a Speedy Settlement prevented him from Searching with studious care into the adions of Var-niSh. Maria loved the amiable Kelan before ffie was Sensible he had gained any more than her esteem. She was happy when he was near her, and felt dejeded as loon as he was gone. Lorenzo Saw the extent of her gratitude. He could not re-fuSe his patron that admittance which the nature of his obligation demanded, and yet it hurt him to feed a

VarniSh once more attempted to give his pupil a reliSh for distipation, he engaged him at Faro. His native goodneSs would not Suffer him to re-^ fufe when Some ladies pressed, but as he knew nothing of the game, and did not enter into the Spirit of it, as he had no wifh for the property of another, the conSequence was, that he lost his own. Two hundred guineas went, and a sigh eScaped him. Not that he was never more to behold the money, but that it had not been put out to better interest; for the money he then Squandered, would gain many different masters, and leave them a prey to wretchednefs, when

VarniSh had on various pretences, made frequent visits to the purSe of Kelan. His purfe was never Shut against necessity. NumberleSs were the excuSes which he framed, but Manfred began to be in pain for Kelan, and came m just as he was making a new demand. As he entered, he heard Something of Maria,— but listen*-ing was a meannels which he never had given way to, and would not now begin. He gave a letter to Ce-J.mder, the eyes of Kelan glistened, ind tears of joy ran down on the paper. But how was he enraptured, ^hen he found that his father ap-oved of his virtuous passion for Maria,

ria. Varnilh had left the room on the entrance of Manfred, who took this opportunity of complaining of the long coolnefs which had Subfisteil on the fide of Kelan. “ I wrote to Celander, I praiSed the beauty and did justice to the virtue of Maria, I painted your affedtion in the strong-st colours, and I entreated him to consider the strong imprestion which she made on you. But why did Ke-‘ i.n make the objecst of his love un-appy ? Why did she Suffer his paS-lons to get the better of his reaSon and wrong the innocence which trusted in him ?” “ I-------could I wrong
the innocence of my Maria? No, Manfred, it is you that have wronged my friendship, and would have Secreted her from me. I never had beheld her more if the excellent Varnish
120 E D W A R D.
' niSh had not affisted me. He loved me better, and pitied my uneafineSsi Tis to the hand of VarniSh that Ke-lan owes Maria. When friends enter into particulars, all is Soon over.
It was with great difficulty that Ke-lan could be convinced how unworthy VarniSh was of his esteem.
Things were in this situation, when word was brought that Ce-lander was expected in town that night, and that Mr. VarniSh entreated that they would by no means leave the houSe until his return. Kelan had intended to have paid a visit to his Maria, but his anxiety to behold his father got the better, and he fat down with Manfred ■— talking of the Satisfaction he expected, and anticipating the joy of his friend Lorenzo,

r^nzo, when by parental permiffion he ofiFered his hand to his incomparable daughter. They waited So long, that they began to give over expectation, and to imagine there must be Some mistake. Manfred hit on it, as he thought, and gave the whole tranS-aCtion to the contrivance of Varnisti.
Kelan therefore refolved to go to the apartments of Lorenzo, and Manfred by agreement remained in the houSe of Varnisti. Kelan flew to Lorenzo's door; he hastened into Ma^ ria's apartment, and exhibited his father’s letter, but the fair one was in tears. Joy was a stranger to her boSom. Her father, the excellent Lorenzo, was at the point of death— Kelan faw him — he affured him that he would protect his darling. VoL. II. F	Lorenzo

Lorenzo gave them his bleffing, snd then yielded his Soul to God.
What a Scene was this for the Sen« Sibility of Kelan ? He wept —she mingled his tears with the tears of Maria — he gave her sigh for figh-^ he felt what She must Suffer by anti*-cipating the loSs he would Sustain in the death of Celander. Thus Were they the very best company for each other — their fouls were rivited in -virtue, and the daughter of wicked-meSs could not approach them.

Manfred came—he* fympathized— he did all in hi-s power to bestow comfort, but nothing could calm the unutterable grief of Maria. Varnisti Soon found he was discovered, and it hurt him to think one So unexperienced ihouid be armed against him. But he now appeared So anxious for the immediate marriage of Kelan, that he found himSelf inclined to forgive, and reinstate him in his favour. This is often the cafe.

- Kelan was not now master of one hundred pounds. His generous heart however acquitted his father, and laid the whole blame on the villany of Var-nisti. The faithful Manfred protested he never would forSake him. The mind of Kelan Sufiered from his ,in-fibility to bestow on Maria what ffie •deferved, and he no longer attempted to perSuade her to accept of one whoSe poffeffions were So few. But Maria

VarniSh was now returned to town, it was his wiSh that the World might think him generous To the Son of his benestidfor. He loved Maria, if Such a creature could be Said to love, and he wilhed to deceive her hushand; but the foul of Kelan difdained to lie under obligation to one he no longer ef« teemed'.
Varnifh began to wonder from what Source he drew his stock of happinefs. The malignity of this wretch was not fatissied with depriving him. of his fortune, he reSoIved to destroy him, and determined to fpare neither expence nor art to accomplista

his diabolical intentions. In the pcrSon of Maria, every charm wlikh can attract was visible. She had trod the paths of truth, and the fra-^grance of virtue hung upon her words. Beauty was the least of her perfections. The enraptured Kelan looked upon her as a treaSure, for which he never could be Sufficiently grateful to the Ring of heaven. Mai^Sred liad wished him to apply to busineSs, but he was a stranger to every Sort. Varnish had a fpy in the aparments of Kelan, and he became acquainted with what paffed in the hours of confidence.

tal wound. But what pen can paint the frantic defpair with which he viewed Maria in the agonies of death ? Varnifh had penetrated her gentle boSom with a dagger, which he had brought with him in cafe of resistance. Kelan was lost in this Scene of mifery —“ the voice of his Maiia at last recalled him to himSelf, She WTis faint with the loSs of blood. All necessary assistance was procured, but, alas! there was no hopes. She began to doze — her hushand never left her — he fondly flattered himSelf She
might recover —— he W'ept----------* he
prayed-----but his virtue was to stand
the test of the Severest affliction, and ' go through that fiery trial, which only can prove our firm reliance on providence. When She awoke, the Smile which angels wear (who look with
pity
A N o V'-E t.
pity oij m^nhkd) was Seep diT her pale countenance. Her words were few——her words tended to remind her lord of the duty he owed his God — in being patient and resigned Sto-his will—and implored him, as he loved her, to listen to the dictates of that reafon, which had hitherto been his guide and companion. She reminded him, that the longest life was but a dream, and that heaven expected patience and fubmistion. She then, after a fe\v moments fpent in a devout ejaculation, met death without fear, and expired in the arms of her beloved hushand.
Manfred had beard confufedly of the tragical affair, and brought Mr, Traffick with him. By his care it ’was that Yarnisti was removed^ and F 6	they

they were both witnefs’ uf his tf^’d rnoments. The horror of his tion made him confcfs that he had^ forged the will of Gelander, and that all the father’s fortune had been left' to Kelan. He discovered many ctneh and unjust acts, confeffed that the unshaken virtue of Kelan, had inSpired him with hatred ; and he acknowledged, that it was his arm which had destroyed the; life of Maria, and the peace of Kelan. His death was not to be Seen without agony, his life was the life of fin.
Manfred came to give the intelligence, Tut Kelan was mournfully cohteshplating the havock that death had rhade — he was weeping over the body of his Maria. At this awful moment a fort of phrenfy Seized on his

He left the feene of hurry, and embarked in one of the strips then-failing for America. He was So fond: of the folitude he had fixed on, where he was at liberty to indulge fo many hours in the recollection of his Maria, that returning was the least of all his thoughts.

To James Wharton, Efq;
I Should long since have informed you of the changes which have taken place in the family of fir William Freemore, if I had not been So much taken up with an affair of no lefs conSequence than matrimony. Yes, Wharton, your friend is absolutely going to enter the list, and does it without fear. LouiSa! of one of the noblest families in this kingdom, and the particular friend of lady Margaret, is the objedt of my choice.
I had been prepared to love her, and was no stranger to the worth
which
A N O V E L.'	145^
which had conneded her in the strongest bonds, to the amiable wife of Freemore. I had feen all the letters which pasted during their abSence from each other, and felt a wifh, which it was not in my power to Supprefs. But She had known what it was to love. A foreigner had poffested her heart, but had baSely requited her warm attachment. He took advantage of the generosity of her unthinking brother, and had brought ruin on that part of her family.	This un-
lucky affair was too much against me, as stie had conceived no very favourable opinion of our Sex. Vanity led me to believe I might be able to change her Sentiments in my favour; but while I was flattering myfelf in building airy hopes, I found that this formidable rival had, by a Severe re-VoL.

And can you think it odd, that one, , who values women for their worth* more than for the trifling advantage of beauty or perfon, should be captivated wish the index of a most excellent, and thoroughly informed mind, which her letters prefented to my view. At last she came, and her appearance completed the vidfory.
I
ANoVEt;	147
I incloSed you the copy of a letter which revived my hopes, and gave me reaSon to expect the completion of my wishes. To make you the more ready to approve my choice, I have transcribed an extract of the various accidents which have befallen my Louila. You will by this means have a con-? vincing proof, that the ways of providence are beyond the power of man to conceive; and that if we perSevere in our belief, though- we have greatly erred, yet there is as much mercy as justice, and that love, mercy, and justice, are the attributes of the Most High. To live with LouiSa, and not iiioralize, is an impostibility.
I am now, at this instant, absolutely in postestion of this dear woman. I hear her,—I listen with rapture to the G 2 Sentiments
148 E D W A R D.
Sentiments which, proceed from her lips, and I adore the goodneSs of God. No longer an enemy of matrimony, I I confeSs it is the only state on earth where felicity may be found. 1 confeSs, with David Simple, that it is the state of friendship, though my heart does justice to my dear Wharton.
Bolder has been found out.--------1
detected a Scheme of his calculated to destroy the peace of Freemore; nay, which must unavoidably have ended in his ruin. My Servant, having married the favourite woman of lady Margaret, was enabled, through he:r generosity and his own Savings, to Set up in bufineSs for himSelf. My place, as it is not a very difficult one, became a Sufficient inducement to Bolder’s man, to give up his master’s Secrets to
obtain.
A Novel.	149
obtain it. I received a very full account in a letter from him of all the proceedings, It had been contrived, that I should be Sent out of the way to receive the last breath and blessing of my uncle ; and I had determined, in confequence of an expreSs, most artfully managed, to Set off the very next morning.
Sir William had (as I before told you) attended little Edward to School, and fir George Sidney accompanied him, During this abSence, Several letters had passed between fir William, and his lady j and I began to think that they were really as happy as I could wish. Bolder did not think it proper to raiSe any Suspicion in the breast of Frecmore, untill he had prepared Some circumstances to give feem-G 3	ing
150 .D D W A R D.
ifig proofs. With this resolution he returned with him. Sir William breathed nothing but love and ten-derneSs,—This little Separation had revived his pafiion, and he reSolved tO’ live quietly in the country, untill the winter months robbed it of its beauties. It was during this calm, that I received the letter I have mentioned. By it I was taught not to give credit to- the exprefs, for that my uncle was in-alF probability quite well. It let me Sufficiently into Bolster’s villainy, and^ after obtaining Free more’s promife to be guided by me, I let him into the affair, and we concerted meaSures accordingly.
This very valuable diScovery I had made by having always uSed my Servants with humanity, by having reflected
A N O V E L*	1.51
fiectedi how ignoble and cruel it is, ^.tq add infolenee and brutality to their dependent situations; for had not ixry place been Such a one as would give cafe and comfort, this felloyv of Bolders had never betrayed the conr sidence which his master had found necestary to repoSe in him.
On pretence of fhewingdady Mar-t garet a very curious plant in the ssbruh-, bery, Bolder contrived to draw ,her ladyfhip on. He feigned a desire of afldng her advice in a love affair.: The noiSe of a carriage drew her attention, and She went near the road-in hopes of Seeing LouiSa. Three men instantly laid hold of her, and forced her into the carriage.
4.	To
152 EDWARD.
To prevent her from being uneafy, fir William had let her into the whole affair, and from Laroux flie received a note of conSolation, and affurances that we would foon be with her.. I Set off in the morning.—It was Bol-der’s contrivance, that her deluded hushand should imagine me guilty; and when he returned, which was Some hours after her ladyship’s departure, he pretended to have received fome wounds, in a vain attempt to defend the lady 5 adding, he began to fear there was Some hidden tianSadlions, which would not do honour to Clermont; for he really believed, I was the perSon who went into the chaife, after having wounded him.
How extremely lucky, are we ^ How much ought we to confeSs and
adore
A Novel. 1^3
adore that Being, who is So watchful over our Safety! and v/ill not al ways permit innocence to be wronged. But for this, Freemore would have stabbed at a heart which would ceaSe to beat, before it could conSent to wrong him.
Freemore aDed his part to admiration — afifedled violent rage ——r would perfue us instantly — threatened death and destruction to his wife, and to the villain Clermont — then thought it best not to give himfelf any trouble, or stir one step after us — but then hastily ordering the wounded Bolder to be attended to, flew away to deprive me of life, and the world of a villain ; Bolder offered to l^accompany him, but this he would by no means hear of. A letter G 5	Sent
154 E D W A R D.
Sent exprefs, demanded his immedi-i ate attendance at the regiment*, (Remark how very deep our hero was.)
But Freemore was So kind as ahfb-lutely not to Suffer him to depart, and the charge which he had given his people rendered it impofiible for the captain to stir untill his return. Things being thus fettled, he repaired to an inn about ten miles from the Dale, and as I was at a little distance ready to join him, we foon made our appearance to lady Margaret, We made numberlefs restedions on the villany, and her ladyship added to our furprile by giving us the encloSed, which Laroux, by BoldeCs order, had delivered.

Bolder.”
You See, Bolder had reSolved to complete his diabolical Scheme, without once Supposing it was poffible for him to be discovered; he did not even think it neceffary to hide his name from the destined vitstim.
Self-love
I
158 EDWARD.
Self-love made it eafy for him believe that She would very Soon be^ perfedfly eaSy in her new situation, nor once regret the hushand She had left. He invented a tale which he imagined fhe would greedily Swallow, and, aided by her vanity, be tempted to revenge.
I must confeSs the prefent times are much in his favour. He has Seen numbers of women lost to every Senfe of goodhefs, with maSculine manners, and rude unprincipled behaviour. His own Soul was a stranger to virtue i no wonder then if he doubted her existence but in fable. It cannot then be wondered, if with fashion on his fide, and without one grain of morality, he made this at-' tempt. He is beneath my anger,
and
A Novel. 159
and as much the objedl of contempt as pity.
Surely, Wharton, we cannot but pity thoSe who are So fatally blind tO' their own interest, as to act in the manner Bolder has done. Lady Margaret has made it a point with Free-more not to put this wretch on the footing of a gentleman, or one moment venture his life, against one marked with infamy, and fo contrived it, as to quiet her fears entirely, I propoSed fir William’s writing a note, requesting his company for a moment, giving him room to imagine he had discovered my retreat, and wanting his immediate assistance in the perSuit. The bait took, and the gentleman came with our mestenger. Lady Margaret retired, and fir William only, met him at the door.
He
i6o E D VV A R D.
He then requested his advice how. to proceed in cafe he should find your humble Servant in the place he had been direded to. Bolder protested that first a horSe-whip, and then a pond, were the only * weapons he would uSe in Such a cafe, and that he thought they would be by far too gentle.
We will Set off then, reply’d the knight, and though I should really find that the Seducer of my wife is a man whom I once cherished in my boSom, yet, by heaven, he shall go through all that you have mentioned. He must be a cowardly dog, and cannot claim the uSage of a gentleman.
One ■
A N o V E	! 6 r
One of fir William’s Servants entered at this moment, and informed his master, that a lady was taken Suddenly ill in the next room, and that he did believe it was lady Margaret. “ Come Bolder, cried fir William, let us go in, we may be of Service, though I can hardly believe it is my wife,” Bolder had no Sort of fear, and therefore - followed the (as he thought) fimple hushand. His Servant had hitherto managed his intrigues too well, to give him any SuSpicion. But what must his emotions have been when he Saw her lady Ship ? He attempted to eScapa,'" but the Servants were prepared for him.
“ What, madam, (exclaimed Free-more) is this dirty inn a fit habitation for the woman I adored ^ But where
is
i62 E D W R D.
is the wretch who has betrayed me ? Tell me this as you hope forgiven eSs.” First convince me, reply’d her lady Ship, that you will not rlfk' your life, and you fhall hear this rb« man tick affair. My life can Be of little confequence to you, but be Satisfied, I con Sent to what you propoSe. My friend Bolder has hit upon an expedient that will prevent blood* fhed.
She then preSented the letter, and to cut the thread of my story. Bolder went through the discipline of the
whip and the horSe-pond-------has since
quitted the army, and gains his breaci by the liberality of thoSe to whoSe vices he connives at.
I
A Note e. 163
1 had the Satisfadlion to See mySelf still dearer to the man for whom I have a very sincere attachment, and the amiable lady Margaret, for whom I have a lively friendship, now enjoys the uninterrupted felicity she deServes.
The boy, whom I have So often mentioned, goes on in all the accomplishments So necesiary in the education of a gentleman, and is postesied of all that honour and integrity which bids fair to make him an ornament, and of confequence to Society. He is^ esteemed by shis master, and Frank Worthy declares it is impoffible not to love him. Brave — without being fool-hardy — generous without pro-fuSeneSs; his School-fellows are happy to obtain his company, and Free more

He had the good fortune to Save the only Son of the duke of ———from being drown’d, and by that means became a very great favourite with his grace,—the boy since died of the effedts of the meafles, and the old duke has now no heir to his estate and titles, but a nephew, who deSpiSes him for his cruelty to his father, Richard. My LouiSa’s brother is now looked upon, as if already in posteS-fion of thoSe titles. In the mean time his grace takes particular notice of Edward, and every Sunday, and other holidays, Worthy accompanies him to GroSvenor-Square.
He
A Novel. 165
He who Suffered his brother to wander, and did not uSe all his interest to prevent his quitting Kngland, is now childleSs, and the .only Surviving Son of that brother, now becomes his heir. Wonderful are thy ways, O God! Man may adore, but not all the united wifdom of the Sex can trace thy wonders, or understand thy motions! Nor will the numberlefs improvements, about which he has employed Such pains, be in the least valued by his SucceS-Sor, determined as he is always to reside in America.
He payed us a Short visit---De
Charmes was with him, but when he received the positive refuSal the in-cloSed contained, he returned directly
to
i66 E D W A R D.
to Quebec, and is there to finifh the remainder of his days.
My LouiSa longs for your company, and indeed, Wharton, when you have once joined this family of love, you will not be in a violent hurry to remove from us,
Kelan—that good old man, is with us, and we are Soon to visit the place of his nativity. In thoSe groves, thoSe delightful walks where he Spent Such happy moments, we Shall of courSe make many reflexions.
Indeed, my friend, there is not a moment of our lives which, (if we chuSe to hear them) does not fur-nilh lelTons of morality. Happy is that man who very early considers
his
A IN o V E L. 167
his latter end. In thoSe hours of gaiety which we have all Seen, more or lefs, we may affedt to deSpiSe the dictates of fenSe; but there will a day^ arrive, when we fhall wilh to have acted with the steady preSeve-rance of Kelan.
You are one of the happy few, who have early quitted the unmean-iiig, giddy, croud, where the glafs circles round, and noiSe, riot, and debauch, constitute the whole amuSe-ment of the night; where, to uSe Kelan’s exprestion, they drink without being dry, and, in their Sober fenSes, fit down with a determined
resolution to rife up beasts-------then

How very different is this from Social converSe, where mutual confidence gives the zest to wit.
I am a Soldier, yet I cannot think my Sentiments diSgrace my profefiion; if I am singular, So much the worSe, I Shall not Serve my country with leSs fidelity for thinking on a future state, and for making my actions paSs in review before me. True bravery can • only proceed from a conScience void of offence. That man is most fit to die, who least fears death.

But all my fears were quieted by the peruSal of a letter from young Traffick; which informed him, that he had Seen the hushand of the nurfe, under whoSe care the child was left, who freely owned, that if the boy, who was nephew to old Worthy, had died, they determined to paSs this infant on him — that it had Succeeded; and would never have been divulged, if his wife had not had a qualm of conScience H 5	before

My companions are in per-fefl health. Edward is fo much beloved, and admired by all ranks, and thofe few ladies, whole duty forces to reside in the garrifon with their hushands and fathers, that I am almost in doubt whether you will ever fee him more. We had like to have had Some quarrels on our hands on our arrival, but the younkers are now convinced, that with all his mildnefs he by no means wants courage, and he is now permitted to enjoy quiet. I wisti he was fairly in England, and fettled

with Charlotte. I have fortune enoiigh for us all; and though Venus, with Minerva’s chastity, was to tempt me,. I could most astliredly withstand her.
The heart which has once been sincerely attached, is for ever wedded to the memory of the beloved object, and the vow remains most Sacred. Pray, is it too Soon to be happy ? Or can lady Margaret fear a change in the inclination of Edward ? Has he not gone through more of the world in five years at Westminster School, than I, with all my v/ifdom, have experienced ? ■ Ms it' then to be feared that he will now turn a libertine ? He has often affured me, that though he loves her as much as it is postible to love a ■	woman.

I did not tell him, that fir William intended that the affair So much wished for by him Should ever take place ; my silence might (by increasing his difficulties) strengthen his paSsion. Such are our materials, that born for fatigue, we lightly regard what is obtained v/ithout Some trouble. He is a most valuable

Stridl in his notions of honour, who can dare to anSwer for him ? Do not therefore let him flip through your fingers.
Shew this letter to lady Margaret, and bid your colonel uSe his interest. When a favour is to be conferred, the Sooner it is done the better, and the more is the party obliged. Let me tell you a Secret — if they will distrefs my Edward, it stiall go hard with me, but I will find him a wife —

Saw her as fhe was going to church— followed her home, and easily found out who She; was. On pretence of having lately left Gibraltar, he came to acquaint Mrs. Stanton of the welfare of her Son. He was too artful not to render himSelf perfedfly agreeable to Mrs. Stanton, and he became a very freequeht visiter; the end of which was his gaining the entire affedtion of Amelia Stanton, and for his fake—and with him—did She forSake her mother’s houSe.

This was the first beginning of that friendship which has since united the marquis and young Stanton. From his Sister’s pen he Soon learned the nature of his obligation ; and to make the affair still more pleasing, Kelan has had the felicity of Seeing his Son joined in matrimony to the blooming Maria; and with them has retired to the paternal habitation of Celan-der.
