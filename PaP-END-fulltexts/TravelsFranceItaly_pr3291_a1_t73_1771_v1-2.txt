LETTER I.
Madam,
IN conSequence of the promiSe you So obligingly exacted when 1 left England, I propoSe to impart what-. ever appears to me worthy attention ; and be perSuaded, every pleaSure, or advantage I may receive from my tra- ., -vels will be infinitely heightened by your sharing them. — I will not give mySelf the trouble of writing, nor you Vol. I. B	that
[ 2 ] '
that of reading, what is to be Sound in every common Journalist ; minute descriptions of towns, buildings, histories oS reliques, &c. In all theSe, there is So much SameneSs, or folly, they can pretend to no merit, except the addition they make to a volume; therefore shall leave them to thoSe who , write their travels at home, and have consequently more leiSure. I will endeavour to amuSe you by a general description of the countries in which I reside, and a more particular one of the manners and customs of the inhabitants, as Sar as I may be in a situation to form a judgment: whatever I Say, shall have all the merit truth can give; the failures which will proceed from not having a capacity adequate to my undertaking, I rely upon your Cjjndor to pardon. May I not even 3	hope.
[ 3 ]
hope you will show Some partiality for the head, where the heart is So entirely
your’s.-----1 landed at Dieppe; it is a
good port, the town has a pleasing aSpect from the uniformity of the buildings, their only merit. Not finding any objects which deServed attention, I proceeded immediately to Rouen. Normandy i9 a beautiful province, I cannot give you a more just idea, than by Saying it resembles the finest counties in England, as well in the produce, as the face of the country, yielding all that is necessary to life in the highest perfection, and greatest abundance, except wine, of which there are but fmali quantities made, and only in the cantons bordering upon the ISle of France; this defect is well fupplied in my opinion by the finest cyder I ever drank. You will B 2	imagine
[ 4 ]
imagine I am going to sill my letters as Montagne did his essays, with the particulars of my taste: no ; as I have not siis merits, I will endeavour to avoid this and all faults as far as possible, though many foibles may be ex-cuSed in a private letter, which could not in a writing designed for the public. — The city of Rouen is large, but ill built; the whole appears unworthy attention, yet upon examination, there are particulars deserving the highest: being the feat of a parliament, gives it I think a preference to Caen as a place of residence. The premier president has distinguished himself by remonstrances which are an equal proof of his capacity, and Patriotism; it is much to be lamented Such talents, when most strenuoufiy exerted, cannot have a reasonable hope beyond impunity. When
a long-
i
[ 5 ]
a longer residence has given me an Opportunity oS receiving inSormation, I shall reSume this Subject; at present will Speak of objects of sight, they permitting an immediate judgment. The most considerable buildings in this city are, the cathedral of Notre Dame, and the church belonging to the BenidictinS of St. Osien, both in the Gothic style, built by the English; they are deservedly esteemed sine pieces of architecture, but So nearly reSembling the principal of the ancient churches in England, they had not the merit of novelty, fo requisite to admiration; consequently I was not pleased equal to the expectations of those who attended me, they asserting these were two of the finest edifices in France.- What were most striking to me, would by no means affect any one who had before B 3	been
[ 6 ]
been in a catholic nation, that is the interior ornaments derived from this religion. You have read So many authors who give a detail of them, I shall not add to their number. In this, as in many other churches, there are eagles amongst the ornaments; Some of the company remarked the impropriety of that figure, as it is generally known to be copied from the decorations in the ancient temples of the Romans, who had the highest veneration for this bird, as a representative of Jupiter. A lady preSent insisted, with great humour, the figure had equal merit as an ecclesiastical ornament, being as just a representative of the priesthood, from the character of a bird of prey, as, from its royalty, of Jupiter. The pleaSure of addressing you, Madam, is So great, I can only prevail with mySelf to
con-
[ 7 ']
conclude by the Superior one oS aS-Suring I am with the highest reSpect and esteem,
Your most obedient, and
Rouen.
most humble Servant, &c.
LETTER II.
T1
O reSume the Subject oS my lash and to do justice to the clergy whom the lady rallied, I must obServe, as far as my acquaintance extends, they are 1 perfons of great merit and piety; Some of them sine orators: their manner of preaching, without notes, and frequently by addresses to the audience recalling attention, has fomething very animated, and adds much to the effect of their eloquence: the English sermons B 4	' have
[ 8 ]
have a great Superiority in the closet, the French as great from the chair; the first Speaks principally to rcaSon, the latter to the passions. Declamation is a talent never neglected by the French, it even enters into the education of girls, who make Such a pro-greSs in this art, or Science, many a woman declaims in the highest degree of perfection, who can only think and
judge in the lowest.--------1 have been
to pay a visit to the fathers de la Redemption, et de la Trinite; the inducement was to fee their gardens, which command a very sine proSpect, the environs of this city being exquisitely beautiful. You are perhaps unacquainted with this order; the only one in my opinion whose existence is Useful, either to the public or individuals* as I can with more ease, and
pre-
l y j
precision, give an idea oS this institution, than the beauties of the proSpect, I shall begin by Saying it obliges them to be perpetually employed, Some at home in raising money, others abroad in disposing oS thoSe Sums, Sor the re-leaSe and conSolation of Christian captives, taken by the Turks or Moors ; this duty they perSorm with much fatigue and Sometimes hazard of their lives : their characters are correfpondent to the piety of their institution. Ladies may be oS the confraternity; I am acquainted with Some who are : ail their engagement confists in recommendincr, and making this their principal charity. I heard a Sermon by one of theSe fathers on Trinity Sunday, the great day of the order : the preacher, after treating the Subject oS the Seast, with a just reverence and humility, displayed his
elo-
[ so ] '
eloquence upon the duties required by the institution, and the merit of assisting k; nothing could be more graceSul than his action and elocution, which were greatly heightened by Srequent references to a picture on the opposite side of the chapel, where Some fathers are represented treating with the Dey of Algiers. The joy of the perSons releafed, the anxiety of the captives who attend that happy moment, the deSpair of others on Seeing the riches of the fathers fo much inferior to their benevolence, gave the highest Subjects for the rhetoric of the orator, as they had before to the art of the painter; the fuccefs of the Speaker was much, very much beyond that oS the artist. — I am afraid you will think I am Seized with the Spirit of preaching; pardon the first and last error oS this kind; the
prelent
[ II ]
preSent is the only letter where you will See me dwell upon the merit of a religious order, however reSpectable Some individuals maybe; but here the whole appears So worthy, I cannot conclude till I have Said theSe fathers, after as great a part of liSe Spent in the duties oS their profeffion as nature will permit, have a hcuSe of peaceable retirement at Montpelier. I Spoke to one of them, who is going there, of the possibility of a general extinction of religious houSes in France : he anfwered, may the duration be equal to their use,' ours is lefs necessary than when erected, if eyer it becomes entirely useless, I wish its destruction. A long letter upon fo grave a Subject will induce you to give an immediate conSent to the favour I aSk of faying I am, Madam,
Rouen. Your most obedient, &c.

P. S. An anecdote I heard oS the King yesterday, deServes to be related. Pasting by la Plaine de Sablons, he Saw the troops assembled for the execution of a Soldier ; afking the cauSe, was an-Swered the man highly merited the punishment, Sor he was a coward, and not willing to Serve his majesty. The king replied, Poor fellow; want of courage is a misfortune; let him live, and Serve me Some other way. I do not Say there was any particular wiSdom in the decision, (nor could it be general,) but you See humanity and 'mercy, the rdarsing attribute of heaven.	;

LETTER III.
A Company of players being arrived, I went to See them perSorm. The French, who are very jealous of the honor of their theatre, desire I will SuSpend my judgment till I have been at Paris; but I Say to them as to you, Srom what I See of theSe actors, I conceive the merit oS thoSe at the capital must be very great. The play I Saw was les Freres Ennemis; Sure never were wrote Sour lines with leSs SenSe, or more mal-a-propos, than thoSe Racine makes Cleon utter upon the death oS Antigone;
AinSi done vous fuyzez un AmantOdieux Et vous meme cruelle eteignez vos beaux yeux-Vous fermez pour jamais ces beaux yeux que j’adore,
Et pour ne me point voir vous les fermez encore.
Do
[ 14 ]
Do you net think there is Something So ingenious in the demonstration of Antigone’s hatred (shuting her eye’s again after she had shut them Sor ever) that it is impossible to find in ancient - or modern poetry any thing which can pretend to a companion, except the two following lines quoted by the Spectator:
* A painted vest Prince Voltiger had on,
Which from a naked Pid his grandSire won.
Some perSons perhaps would lessen the merit oS my countryman from his antiquity, but there are points where ! the advantages and privileges oS the 1 ancients and moderns are equal. I have heard rhyme is a terrible restraint upon a great genius; it may be So: but I- am Sure it is not unfavorable to a moderate one, Sor the most ordinary
u. der-
[ i5 1
understanding could not Support the nonSenSe oS the above quoted lines, if they had been in profe : our poem has long been antiquated, for Racine’s I am perfuaded several French read it to this day without difcovering the ab-furdity. As to the impropriety of dwelling upon the beaux yeux oS a per-Son in Antigone’s situation, which raiSes a general tendernefs and affliction instead of particular admiration, and the inconsistency of love with the general character of Cleon, I do not wonder they receive no cenSure ; being in the style of the nation. I know Racine ex-cufes himSelf with regard to the Saults of this piece, by Saying it was a juvenile perSormance. To paSs by the defects in general; yet a boy, iS he (jtould write a tragedy at ten years old, yvould not be pardoned thoSe Sour lines.
Indeed
[ i6 ]
Indeed a child could not err So much against nature. It is astonishing Racine should not correct or eraSe them, when at a' more mature age he wrote the preface to this piece. His Athaliah is -a sine poem, and he has Some other pieces oS merit; in general, I do not think he deServes the great applauSe the French give him ; he often falls / into the error of drawing all his characters fo like his countrymen: from whatever nation he takes them, antique or modern, he brings to my remembrance a very common story I have heard, of a painter, who was defired to paint the fign of a red lion ; as he was only capable of drawing one figure, and that not the requifite, he made many excuses to avoid attempting any other; at last upon the perfon’s infisting, he faid, if you will have a red lion, you
shall
[ 17 J
shall have a red lyon ; but I give you notice, it will be extremely like arose.—
I am, Madam, with great regard,
Rouen. Your most obedient, &c«
LETTER IV.
I A M this moment returned from, the Cour, it is the most beautiSul walk that can be imagined; you paSs the Seine by a bridge of boats, esteemed a great curiosity; being constructed in Such a manner, the heaviest carriages go over 7 with SaSety, and it is opened with much facility Sor the paffage of ships: on the leSt of the bridge is the Cour, which is a considerable length, planted very beautifully, and though .very wide,
Vo l, I.	C	covered
[ is 1
covered by the uniting oS the trees. The river on one side, and the hills rising into an amphitheatre ; the view into the country, in the front, and rearming, that oS the ships, quay, and town in the front; Sorm a Scene as variegated, and pleasing, as ever I beheld : this charming Cour is not in general much frequented by people of fashion; but on AScension-day, the equipages are very numerous, and the citizens with the peafants innumerable.. I do not know that I was ever more struck with drefs, than by the variety the female peafants presented. The province of Normandy lias Several districts, each has a peculiar habit, Some are very graceful and sine ; the women of the Pais de Caux are more distinguishable by the Superiority of their figures than their dreSs, except to
French
r19 ]
French men, who are as much charmed by the one as the other. I could not help thinking I Saw the inhabitants oS twenty different nations, when I was only beholding the peaSants of Normandy, who came from every part of the province, rather to honour the patron Saint of the city, than the great and general festival celebrated the fame day.
This faint, as their legend teaches, attended by two malefactors, kllled a dragon that laid waste the country; in memory of this event, the canons of the cathedral have a right to demand the release of one prifoner capitally convicted. A gentleman, who killed . his servant in a passion, received the •benefit of this anniverfary. A ridiculous circumstance is Said to have happened fome years since at the procession, when the reliques of the Saint and si-C 2	gure
[ 20 ]
'sure of a dragon are carried about the city, an old woman So much mistook the object of veneration, she kneeled and Said her Ora pro nobis to the beast, instead oS the faint. Incredible as this may. appear, the next Sestival gave a proof the woman was not singular in her regard Sor the dragon, though rather outree. The procession beginning without him, the disappointment was So great, and the Sury cS the people aroSe to Such a height, they threatened to Set sire to the epiScopal • palace, if the dragon was not produced; in conSequence oS this tumult, he was reinstated in all his honors, which I believe no one since has dared to dispute. Whenever you find my letters neither entertaining nor instructive, which I Sear will be very often, treat them with the contempt they de-
Serve,
[ 21 ]
Serve, and though I hope you will pardon their deSects, do not honor them with So precious a tribute as your time.
A French man in company has led me into the trivial digression above, but i-t •. -is my own Sentiments direct, when I have the pleaSure oS proSeffing the high esteem with which I am, Madam,-
Roiien. Your most obedient, &c

X_> E Palais is worthy attention, the parliament who there preside, are So in a much higher degree ; as Sar as my knowledge permits, I will Speak of theSe magistrates. I am perSuaded you know the word parliament in France,
* -	-	C 3	has
[ 22 ]
has by no means the fame acceptation as in England; though the perSons who compote that, oS this nation, affert the identity of their original privileges and functions. The diScusion of this point would carry me beyond tlie limits of my preSent design; I will only Say, however reSembling in their origin, the British has gained, and, perhaps, the French lost, So many privileges, and fo much power, at preSent there is Scarce any reSemblance but in name: the principal light in which a French parliament is to be considered, as to its effects, is, the first court of justice in the kingdom ; to which all perSons, not content with the judgment of the magistrate where they reside, may appeal: there are likewife cauSes never within the cognizance of inferior courts. The parliament is compoSed of presidents a
mor-
[ 23 ]
merrier, (So called Srom a bonnet or cap they wear) prefidents, and conseil-leirs de parlement; the difference of theSe, consists rather in precedency, and points of honor, than any distinct privileges ; the prefidents a mortier Say they repreSent the peers, who compoSed a part of the ancient parliaments ; the presidents claim a Superiority over the counSeillcirs, which the latter do not allow; this is certain, they all sit in judgment together, and give the ir voices; the advocates anSwering to the counsellors in England, being pleaders. There are considerable offices attending the parliament, as procureur-gene-ral, &c. all charges are venal, which appears at first sight a great defect; but I am convinced the duties of thefe offices are much better performed, than if the perfons were appointed by the <C 4	cc u ;
[ 24 ]
court: in general, the Son buys the place of his father, and So on Sor many generations; a certain point of honor deScends with the office, which could not be expected in thoSe whoSe interest with the ministry procured this magistracy ; as in the first Samily honor is joined to perfonal reputation. It is true, Some rich merchants purchaSe theSe charges Sor their Sons, as it gives a Sort of nobleSs (though not the first) ; but their number being Small, they are carried away by the Spirit of the body, which is that of the public good, when-, ever they have the privilege of asserting it. In the decision oS causes I be-sieve they are very just, many circumstances combining to render their corruption more difficult than other courts in France. The great number of per- ! Sons oS Superior merit, who compole
the
[ 25 ] .
the parliaments of this nation, makes me wish the word Protection was never known, as it is thoSe who have caufes depending, Sometimes endeavour’ to form an interest with their judges, in a more attentive manner than could be, if SucceSs wTas absolutely impossible to be gained by that method. I never consider the constitution and govern-
O	«
ment of other nations, without applauding my own, which I think Mon-teSquieu obServes, is as near perfection as any can be, which is formed by mortals.—A Seat may be bought in parliament at twenty-one, but they have no vote till twenty-five; the early age at which they enter this assembly is no inconveniency, on the contrary, requisite-, as they very often have not followed any study proper to the profession ; but the time of giving their
votes
[Z6]
•votes should be retarded, their ignorance might be corrected by the knowledge of others, if their youth did not incline them to take their paffions for their guides. However, the majority .will ever be juft. In general, the women are employed to make interest in all affairs in France, even though the principal perfon concerned is of the other Sex; you will pardon me, madam, if I do not imagine it is always their Superiority of genius which gives them this preference. Is it not a great defect in the manners of a people, when a ! woman can quit her dignity and delicacy fo far, as to become a Suppliant, and ' as great a defect in the constitution to Suffer her, if manners could be controlled by laws ? I am, madam, with the highest refpect,	,

P. S. At a Supper where I was preSent, amongst Several Bon mots which were repeated, one I think is good; it was Said upon marshal Saxe’s going to be interred in Germany : What, not one de Profundis for him who gave us So many Te Deums ! to illustrate the lady’s wit, perhaps, I should tell you the pSalm de Profundis is Sung before the corpSe in the burial Service of the Roman church. I thought none but a Roman catholic could have been Marshal of France ; am told they made this objection to Saxe; who anfwercd, My Sword is a good catholic ; which-was accepted without any farther profession. Be this as it will, historical truth is not necessary to what 1 have related : perhaps the occasion was made for the Bon mot, instead of the Bon mot Sor the occasion. The French are So fond
of
[ 28 ]
of this kind oS wit, they have a Saying, Que les Francois Se damneront pour un Bon mot.
LETTER VI.
1 WA S last night at the Cid, a piece which though it gave riSe to the best '' Satyr in this language, yet gave me very great pleafure; an English man does not insist upon being pleaSed according to rules, or he could not be So highly charmed by ShakeSpear: Corneille, in the tragedy of which I am Speaking, has Succeeded better than the French generally do in foreign characters ; they are more acquainted with the Spanifn than any nation, except
[2 9 ]
cept the English, and have Srom the Royal Relation, connections with them, they have not with us. I do not think the French writers Succeed in British characters, with them we are all mercantile and rough; they do not comprehend the variety in England: a commercial nation we certainly are, and compared to the French, perhaps our manners in general may be plain; but amongst a great number of other characters, you may See in England more accomplished men, and as sine gentlemen, as any that ornament the court of France. The Spanish character is known and represented with more facility than the English, as it consists of Sew points Strongly marked, not in the least diversified. The French, though public interest and alliances unite them to the Spaniards, yet think
and
130 ]
and Speak of that nation with hatred and contempt; I know not from ^ whence this Can proceed, except contrariety of disposition. I have observed ■the most distinguifiied merit can Scarce reconcile the French to a grave reserved character: they look upon the Spanifii nation as in a state of total ignorance and darknefs; of which the following fable, quoted against them by a wit of my acquaintance, is a proof; it is new to me, an idea it may , be the Same to you, engages me to
o-ive it as near as the translation will ,
&
permit in the words of the Speaker------ 1
c< Adam being desirous to know and , ’ fee his race, whose numbers had overspread the earth, and Fame had reached the Heavens; particularly the Europeans as the most distinguished; deter-1	mined
[ 3i ]
misted to visit the celebrated nations cf this part oS the globe. Pie defcencled in the kingdom of France : arts, agriculture, arms, and architecture had So entirely changed the face oS the earthy and the inhabitants, he immediately disclaimed them as his offspring. He then turned his steps to Germany, Holland, and England yet found nothing to awaken his paternal affection t but the moment he cast his eyes upon the Spanish realms, the great progenitor’s heart was silled with rapture :• Behold 1 Said he, Thefe, These, are my true Children, in whom time has made no change; they and their country are „ in the Same state that I and nature left them.”
This Fable has, ift my opinion, as much praifc, as reproach, though the
latter
[ 32 r
latter is intended. If the Spaniards-have made leSs improvements in the arts , and Sciences, than other nations, they have, as I am Informed, and as this fatyr allows, preferved a greater degree of truth and sincerity : qualities which in the affairs of life, highly compenfate every deficiency, and no others can Supply their defect; even in Society they are the most pleasing and requisite. Wit and knowledge may charm for a time, but lasting Satisfaction can alone be Sound where truth is the dictator;	;
witneSs the hours, days, and years, j perSons of Superior genius paSs with | thoSe, from whoSe conversation they can receive no joy, or Solace, except hearing and Speaking with freedom. I. know a coterie in France composed of ' perSons who have Seen each other almost 1 every day for twenty years, without 3	any
[ 33 ]
any other tye than friendship; the greatest talents cannot find topics constantly interesting in , themSelves, but all become So in Such a Society; liberty and truth give charms beyond expression to the meerest trifle. “To many vices a rnan may be inclined by constitution (Says a good writer) but no man is a constitutional liar ;” far otherwise, we not only enter the world true, but continue the Same, till Sometimes, finding we play sterling against'counters, to be upon a par with others we quit that virtue which has no equivalent ; in the pleasing view of pasting my life in an union, I hope truth her-Self has Sormed, I am, Madam,
Rotten.	Your most obedient, &c.

LETTER VII.
JL H E Roman or civil law prevails* in this nation : the progreSs \ I have: made in N this study, though not considerable, is yet Sufficient to. add much to my pleaSure in reading the extraordinary trials, which have been decided by the parliaments; you may have them in England by the title of Les CauSes Celebres, they are ill writ, but from the particularity of the Subjects, are both amusing and instructive; and the decisions, which are in general by the civil law, appear to me So eaSy and natural, reaSon alone might direct them; add to the general laws, each province has its peculiar customs and privileges, by which the inhabitants are to be -	judged
[ 35 ]
judged with regard to inheritances, and many other affairs ; a knowledge of theSe customs requires a long residence in this nation, and much study ; at the Same time is uSelefs to a stranger; the great variety oS theSe customs produce So many inconveniencies, it has been propoSed to make a general code Sor the kingdom. The attachment oS each province to its particular uSages, has hitherto, and I believe ever will prevent * this Scheme taking place. I have heard the parliaments have had a desire to Sorm themSelves into one body, but the strength they might acquire by Such an union, is too well apprehended Sor that union ever to be permitted ; how greatly the parliament of Bretagne has distinguished itSelf is well known, and the conSequences. The members are all perSons of high birth, to which D 2	their
[ 36 ]
their Sentiments are adequate ; in them has been Seen to what the privilege of remonstrances are reduced; the privilege is no leSs than giving counSel to the king, but the effects are Srequently no other than might be expected Srom a petition, except the danger. I do not find the most Spirited remonstrances at preSent are attended with any other conSequences, than the diSgrace oS the authors by the court, and the applaufe of a Sew wiSe men; all struggles are vain for the liberty oS thofe who have not the Spirit to desire and affert this bleffing, the greatest mortals can knows if they have been accustomed to it; but there must be a total change in the manners and Sentiments oS the French to render them capable oS enjoying Such happineSs. The Subject in which I am engaged appears too diffusive Sor a letter.
[ 37 ]
ter, I shall Sor this reaSon leave the remainder Sor a particular treatife or conversation, that I may, as I propoSed, give you a general and clear idea of the Parliaments in this nation, which I have not at preSent. The ideas I could wish you to have in the highest perfection, are thoSe regarding the fidelity and reSpect oS, Madam,

LETTER VIII.
I Have been to pay a visit to the Poor Claires : convents are places I do not much frequent; but this being compoSed entirely of English, it was a compliment due to the nuns; it is of all orders the most rigid, being a reform D 3	upon
[ 38 ]
Upon the Benedictins: they do not appear even at a grate; a wall with iron Spikes was between us during the conversation; their voices are So attenuated by Sasting and mortification, they Sounded like that of Lungs in the Alchymist, when he Says the sire burns blue ; they have a great though mistaken piety ; a lady oS the VavaSour Samily presides with Superior merit: wherever the English have convents, they are distinguished even by the , French ; but it is a reputation I should never wish them to acquire, as I think they are too valuable in every character oS life to quit it. I was preSent not long since when a beautiful young girl took the habit, but that beauty will Soon be Saded by the austerities of her life : she performed the ceremony with great chearfulnels, when she quitted
the
%
T 39 ]
the habit of the world, the ornaments oS which she stings from her with the greatest diSdain; she disappeared Sor Some time, then came into the choir in a white habit and garland of flowers; the choir is very long, and with the nuns arranged on each Side in black, and ill-drest, (Sor they wear their habits nine years) she really looked like Something deScended from the heavens; it was impossible to behold this amiable figure without the utmost regret; Sor notwithstanding the Satis Saction which then appeared in her countenance, I Sear she will ere long have other Sentiments : but to leave So melancholy a Subject, I will relate a chearSul event, told to me by a Superior oS a convent: a young lady was Sent to one of theSe religious houSes by her parents, who Intended (as is most cruelly and fre-D 4	quently
[ 40 ]
quently the caSe) to force her to take the veil; she having far other views for herSelf, beSought them most humbly and earnestly to release her; but was only anfwered by the most cruel threats if she did not comply with their commands : at length, she consented to six the day ; when amidst the concourSe of people, who attended the ceremony, was seen a young gentleman, to whom the intended nun’s affections were known to be engaged; nor was there any objection to the marriage, except the other children being not fo rich: all the fpectators were furprized the gentleman could be present at a cere- I mbny, that was melancholy even to indifferent people wsho have sentiment; blit how great was their astonishment increased, when upon the lady’s approach, instead of the ufual ceremony,
she
[ 4i ]
fne declared in the Sorm oS marriage, she took that gentleman Sor her huf-band ; to which he anSwered in the Same terms, agreeable to their engage-ment: the confusion oS the parents being too great to expreSs an immediate disapprobation, the contract, being made in the preSence oS the bishop, was judged good, and the marriage followed. I should imagine the parents were glad to compromile the affair, Sor they had intended to commit an action as unlawful, as the lady’s marrying without their conSent. If upon thefe occasions a girl has courage, and friends to assist her, in making a protest before she takes the veil, her vow, as being involuntary, is void ; but they are in general lb frightened, watched, and per-fiiaded, very few can defend themselves. It is thought a parent’s power cannot
be
[42].
be too extensive, experience will convince that oS doing ill cannot be too limited in any perSon. I am, with great , esteem, Madam,
Rouen. Your most obedient, &c,

heard: you will imagine cards have their share in the diversions, though I ' efcape them very well: dancing is a talent in which the French are known to excel, but do not exercise much more than the English: in England, generally Speaking, the ladies furpafs the men in this art, here it is the reverse, the women being very often educated in convents, and in Some of those houfes, they do not permit a dancing-master ; Such a restraint alone can make thoSe people dangerous : I fpend two or three evenings in a week with a Select coterie of several ladies, who have fuperior talents and merit, Some gentlemen of the • robe, and an officer, w..o adds to the Science of his profession, (i i which he has been distinguished)

[ 45 ]
good Society: you have Seen in Voltaire, though a colonel, (and I know inferior officers) may dine with the king, a chancellor cannot; but I conclude the king may break through the etiquette if he pleafes : he is not So dilpoSed, iS it is true that he Sorbad mademoiffelle D’eguilly, the Samous Amazon, to hunt with him after she married a president: I should not imagine his majesty could be So defective in politeneSs to the Sex. As to the general contempt for the robe, and honor Sor the gens d’epee, it is too much the interest of the court to be continued: notwithstanding theSe courtly Send- -ments, many of the parliament are good gentlemen oS birth, have all high rank in their province, and great merit to the nation. I Set out to-morrow for Amiens, an agreeable party inclining i	me

To PON my arrival at Amiens, the capital oS Picardy, I enquired for the objects which deServed attention; they Showed me the cathedral, a very sine large edifice, with a profufion of carving and ornaments, as uSual in Gothic buildings; it has been a dilpute whether this church is a work oS the English or French, the preSent decision is in favour of the latter, to which I Submit; Some of the carvings are
ap-
E 47 ]
apparently English from their Subjects ; ir the French chufe to claim them, I do not think they deServe a contest. I might have Seen, as the Sacristan af-Sured me, the real hand oS John the Eaptist, but as I have heard of a gentleman who has Seen Seven equally authenticated, I did not think one a curiosity worth regarding. From the cathedral I went to the Lautoir, a beautiful and extensive walk, much preferable to the ramparts: the French embellish theie fort of public places more than we do; indeed we have Scarce any in provincial towns, and in France few boroughs are without them : the plan- -tations on the public roads add much to their beauty, and that of the country. Amiens is a great trading city; I should rather Say, most of the inhabitants are engaged in commerce, but it
Is'
[ 4« ]
is very far from being in a flourishing state. The genius of the French is by no means adapted to business, the great passion for drefs and dissipation in the low people, is incompatible with the fpirit of commerce. Lyons and Some other towns fucceed from the great advantage of their situation; but where-ever the principal hopes are founded upon French industry, they will fall to the ground: the nature of their government, tends to the encouragement of idlenefs, as does their religion; the great number of convents, holidays,
• perpetual processions, the prodigious standing army, which takes the men from their labour when young, and j Sends them home to increase the number of beggars when old; all thefe cauSes combining, it is no wonder here are, as I am inSormed, three thouSand
Poor
[49]
poor in the streets, and thirty thousand upon the bishop’s list; more than a third; of the inhabitants.——It is in general the fashion Sor the Noblesse, who are not rich enough to go to Paris, to make the capital of the province their place of residence for the greatest part of the year ; but Abbeville is preferred, at present, to Amiens. After what I have faid, you will not be furprized I fpend my time rather in study, than fociety. I would pay a visit to' the celebrated Mons.. Greffet, author of the Vert Vert, who resides in this city ; but as he is grown a devot, I am afraid he ceases to be a wit. I am told, before his conversion (as it is called) the bishop threatened him with punishment, For the just and happy ridicule with" which he had attacked the nuns, in the above-mentioned poem ; he only an-swered, 
r jo i
fwered, he had another piece, of equal force, ready for the prefs, against the Secular clergy. The bishop thought proper to make peace, by giving Such benefices as his situation permitted him to accept; for though educated, with the intentions 'of his friends, to be a jefuit, he quitted that fociety, and married. As I have mentioned the bishop, it will be but justice to fay, he is equally distinguished for his piety and morality, with an unaffected, affable, and chearful behaviour to all who present themselves. It is impossible, when you first reflect upon the merit of this venerable old man, not to think with Pope,
For modes of faith let graceleSs zealots fight;
His can’t be wrong, whoSe life is in the right.
But, upon farther consideration, though one cannot, approve of sighting, yet it must be wished, as his zeal is fo great,

advantages may be reaped from the Society of French, who have a moderate share of knowledge, than from many English, who have the most extensive ; at least, when the acquain-, tance is short : as it is probable the latter may not impart any degree of bis fcience ; and it is possible the former will be fo generous as to give the whole. I have known fome perfons in England, who would rather be for ever silent than fpeak any thing in general fociety, unbecoming the genius which distinguishes them. This character has certainly much dignity ; but dignity is inconsistent with the general humor of the French. Vive la bagatelle is their language, and their actions, are correfpondent. The communicative difposition of this nation, is fome-times difagreeable, but is. frequently
useful

useful to a stranger. They add to this desire of talking, an astonishing curiosity, which proceeds from an incapacity of entertaining themfelves, and is highly inconsistent with that good breeding fame has given them: they will ash every possible question concerning your-felf, family and affairs, and in return leave nothing unfaid which regards theirs: the misfortune is, I and most English ' are too incurious to render the pleafure reciprocal. I have often been in French company, who justify the following observation of La Bruyere, Us parlent on moment avant que de penser: a Frenchman alone could have had that idea. I must fay this for an excuse, if they waited for thought to precede their words, they would, in general, be for ever silent. To keep myself in humor with a nation, in which I propose to , E 3	reside

The Place de Louis Quinze, will be extremely sine, in all refpects, when it is finished. The Hotels already erected, are most magnificent, and of exquisite architecture: those of the nobility, in general, are very grand, much furpaffing the houses of perfons of the fame rank in England: but the citizens of London are better lodged than people of that clafs in Paris. The capital of each nation demonstrates the Spirit of its government : Paris has most magnificence; London is more equally handfome. Luxury and po-E 4	verty,
[ 5.6]
yetty, riches and ease, form the characters and contrast of thefe great cities. In Paris, the whole expence of the kingdom, is for the king and nobility ; in London, for the people in general. St. James’s is called a palace, as it is the lodging of a king: the Louvre, Luxemburg, &c. command this title from their own grandeur and magnificence. However inferior we tnay be in royal buildings, England has raised to God, and built for the public, edifices, to which France can shew no equal. The walks in Paris are very-charming ; but of thefe you have heard fo much from your acquaintance, I shall not enter into particulars. Most of the hotels of the nobility have gardens, and all courts, which renders them more agreeable to the inhabitants, but lest ornamental to the city. I was
walk-
[ 57 ]
walking in the Thuilleries, with a man of quality, the other day, and remarking the great number of palaces the king of France never inhabits, particularly the Luxemburg (which is repairing, though unfinished) I Said, laughing, I wished one of them could be transported into England, Sor the uSe of his Britannick Majesty. To my infinite furprize he anfwered, with great warmth, he fuppoSed I had rather see the king of England possess it in France ; adding, that day would never arrive. It was with difficulty I convinced him my meaning did not go beyond my expression, assuring him, ‘ at the fame time, the wishes of the English were not greater than those of the French. I acknowledge, in this affair, Le Bruyere’s observation might, » in Some degree, be applied to me ; but
I have
[5*]
I have not hitherto lived with people who are SuSceptible; I find they are more So in the capital, than the provinces. They are Sensible oS the Superiority we had in the late war, and think we are as much elated, as I have heard that nation was when SucceSs was theirs; this inclines them Sometimes to construe as an affront, what is intended as a compliment. A French gentleman observing the Superiority of the English in their knowledge of languages, was an-fwered, C’est un acquit qui ne vous est point neceffaire, car pour la langue, vous, clonnez le ton a toute l’Europe, ct vous monsieur, Said the Frenchman, in anger, Vous le donnez Sur les armes : How can we love the English ? they more than hate, they deSpiSe us. TheSe Sentiments have been taken Srom English authors, which it is the mode to .	study
3
[ 59 ]
study, or rather read ; Sor no one who visits this kingdom, and is received into the Societies, could be So ill-bred and impolitic, as to Say any thing that might offend, except by accident; which could not have So strong an effect. Whatever are the Sentiments of the nation, the English are, in general, well received ; many give their esteem and merit; it should be reciprocal. High as Voltaire has drawn the character of the French noblesse, in point of honor, he has not more than rendered them justice. Whenever the arms of this nation are attended with fuccefs, the glory is all theirs : the love of life and pleafure are fo strong in the French, there can be no principle to balance it in the common people; but the high sentiment of honor in the noblesse, is more than equivalent to any
dii-
[ <So ]
disadvantage they may receive from nature and education. The nobility, in general, are much leSs learned than in England : this is not Surprizing upon reflection ; Savor at court is the first merit, and arms the only honorable means of Serving their country; consequently the Science they most endeavour to acquire. Education, in general, is much inferior to the British. The wiSe and unprejudiced part of the nation, are Senfible, and lament that it is So. The partizans oS the JeSuits affert their expulfion will be injurious to the public in this point: they certainly poffeSs much learning; but I cannot Say here are great prooSs they communicated their knowledge to the kingdom in general. The fathers of the oratory, who had before a confiderable , share in the education of youth, will
now
[ 6i ]
now have a greater. TheSe are a Set of learned and honest men, who, perhaps, may give as much knowledge, with better principles, to their pupils ; they are not engaged by vows, but live in a fociety which they are always at liberty to quit; but generally continue in to the end of life, if no particular event recalls them to the world. Some of these fathers have been charged with Jansenifm ; an accuSation not uncommon against those who regard morality as an essential part of religion, either by their doctrine, or their lives. I know a priest who, in a sermon, told the women of his parish, they had much -better be faithful wives, good mothers, and peaceable neighbours, than visit Notre Dame de Clery, and there make vows to wear white or brown : he was immediately called a Jansenist, and,
in
[62]
in a more conspicuous situation, might ’ have been interdicted ; Sor his liSe would witneSs against him, being perfect as that of man can be. I know a gentleman who Said, he thought there could be difference enough between the English and French nation, to make the latter worth visiting; nothing would Serve him but the Antipodes ; I think, in Some points, he might here find them in Sentiments.

I HAVE been at the Palais Royal ; it Is impossible to expreSs the pleaSure I received Srom the large and valuable
col-
r 63 ]
collection of paintings with which it is ornamented. I had much regret in feeing Some, that once adorned the palaces of the kings oS England, and were Sold by Oliver Cromwell. To Speak of - all the pictures, with my Sentiments upon them,would make a large volume; the catalogue makes a Small one : indeed the great quantity and variety Scarce leave a power of dwelling upon any ; yet one has So particularly struck me, I wish I could give the ideas as strong as they are imprinted on my mind : this admirable piece is the Ma-dona with the child JeSus, and St. John; nothing can exceed the beauty, ' nor the propriety of the beauty, given to the virgin. In our Saviour, the innocence of the child is blended with the wiSdom oS the divinity, in a most marvellous manner. In St John, the propriety
[ I ,
priety of character is equally preServed ; amidst the beautiful Smiles oS the playing infant, may be diScerned the growing Sanctity oS the preacher : this piece is by Raphael; it is styled, La Jardiniere, from the dreSs of the Madona.
I was So highly pleaSed with theSe * paintings, I Sat at home the whole evening to enjoy them in idea. I have been at the Luxemburg palace to See the gallery ; Rubens’ design is very great, and the paintings are a just and noble ornament to the apartment; but there are too many Saults, nor are their beauties high enough to place them, or their author, in the rank they receive Srom the French : the prints which you have Seen, give a more exact idea-of theSe paintings than is possible Sor my pen. The hotels oS the noblesse have Some very valuable paintings. The 3	Duke

The circumstance of being long absent from a. beloved perfon, is alone a pain too great to be repaid by the pleafures of travelling, or even by the acquisttion of the. highest knowledge, as far as it can regard oneself; but the idea of being serviceable to my country, and the hopes-of being more agreeable,,where 1 already flatten myself with a preference,.

In Speaking of the diversions of Paris, I shall begin with the opera ; oS which the French boast much, with little reason. The Coup D’oeil, is certainly very sine ; all the advantages that can be derived from machinery and decorations are given to this entertainment:
w
but Sure music should, at least, make a part of the merit of an opera; and I am certain a perSon must have French ears, or none, who can receive pleafure F 2	■	. from
[ 63 J
from this performance at Paris. Castos and Pollux, is esteemed, by the French* one of their best compositions, in which what should be music is noise, and the singing extravagant streams. The dancing, I acknowledge very Sne, that it is the forte of the opera they are very fenfible, as may be seen from the great use they make of it. Gods and devils, men and women, on every oc-cafion compofing a ball, fome descending, others arifing,. for this grand purpose : in short, the fun and moon dan- | cing a minuet, would be no burlefque here; on the contrary, they would meet with high applause; and if,, by their influence, the Sars could be perfuaded to step down, and form a little cottih Ion, the whole house would be in raptures. A gentleman from Italy, and myself, were the only difcontentcd perform
1 «9 ]
Sons at this performance : though I have not been in that musical nation, I will affirm, none but a vitiated ear can -prefer the French to the Italian mufic. Rouffeau obServes, performing a piece of the composition of each nation before a Savage, the-pleaSure he will demonstrate Srom hearing the Italian, and pain Srom the French, are strong declarations of nature, in -favor of the former. Without calling in the Savages (whom a little afraid to trust from their known love of noise) the judg- ’ ment of every polished nation (except their own) is decifive enough against the French. To allow all the merit ; that can be given them, they have great execution; and it must be this excellence which has inclined fome of cny countrymen to fpeak in favor of F 3	French

French music, and musicians, as, to my Surprize, I have heard them. I believe I shall not be singular in declaring (on the contrary, it is almost too general a Sentiment to write) expression is what I principally Seek in music, and every other Science where it can poffi-bly enter : it is the great talent oS the Italians, whenever they do not chuSe rather to raiSe wonder than give delight. The only Sort oS music I hear with pleasure in France, is the little Vaudevilles, or ballads, Sung at table ; and in theSe the ladies particularly excel, by the Spirit and expression with which they embellish them ; though I cannot Say the Subjects are always adapted to a Se-male performer, as they are Sometimes inconsistent with that delicacy and modesty which is the ornament of your Sex,

I AM very happy when I can give applauSe to the talents of a nation against whom we are SuppoSed to be prejudiced : the highest is due to what I call the French Theatre, Srom its Superiority : the merit of their authors is known to you ; that oS their actors is adequate to the greatest. We have, in England, Some performers who cannot be excelled ; but thofe who
play
[ 73 ]
play the Second roles, are frequently very indifferent : here every part is equally fustained. I have seen theMe-rope, and Semiramis of Voltaire; which I think pieces of great merit ; they have exquisite strokes of nature, and what does not always happen in theatrical compositions, the moral is sine, and particularly adapted to the nation for whom it is wrote ; where, from the dissipated humor of the people, as well as the relief given by the Roman Catholic, remorfe for a wicked action may fometimes wear qff too foon, The French do not esteem Voltaire’s plays the best cf his works: they are not those which require, nor demonstrate most genius ; but I think fome of them are more perfect than any thing he has. wrote, and have the highest of all me- ‘ rks; they may be useful, and cannot be
3 injurious
[ 7+ J
Injfifious to mankind.-------I have not
been So fortunate in the comedies represented as tragedies : of the former, Le Legataire, by Renard, is one at which I was preSent: it has great humor, and the actors rendered perfect justice to the fpirit of the author ; but I do not like the plan of the play : the hero, if the nephew is to be regarded in that light, is not rogue enough to give detestation ; yet far from being Sufficiently honest for imitation.. If the • servants are to be considered as a principal part, this circumstance alone, to me, is an objection : the actors are fo .excellent in comedy and tragedy, it is difficult to Say in which they are Superior : Mademoiffelle du MeSnil has great merit in the latter, and many others who are her inferiors; but, upon the whole, I think pmedy has the pre-.
ference.
[ 75 ]
ference. The French have, in general, a Surprizing talent Sor representation •, they have great quickneSs of sights the livelineSs oS their diSpoSition inclines them to action in common conversation : add to theSe qualifications, having rather a general than particular character, they, with much facility, affume that proper to the occasion, and the perSonage they repreSent. I have beSore obServed, declamation is common to them all; I may likewiSe Say, a modest astiirance.
The music of the petit opera is very pleasing ; but I cannot approve a piece joined to this entertainment, where- -Harlequin is the hero and orator : his, wit consists in blunders ; Such as Saying, he was shipwrecked contre un Ecureuil, inftead oS an Ecueil : all the grimace and humor with which he uttered this 3	Speech
[ 76 ]
Speech could not make me simile,-though I had never heard it beSore ; but the whole houSe were'in the loudest laugh, to whom, I am perSuaded, it had not even the merit of novelty. The French, who are in general ceco-nbmists, are particularly So in their Jests. I once travelled with a party who' amu-Sed themSelves two days in stealing a gentleman’s Snuff-box; every repetition gave equal pleaSure, and when they Separated, the loSs of So much humor was mutually regretted; 5 would not be thought to infer from hence, this kingdom has not many perSons of excellent Society ; I know it has, and their merit is greater Srom the difficulties with which it struggles and Surmounts. In genera], die English excel the French in wit and humor, as much as in Solid Sense and learning; as
may
[ 77 ]
may be easily Seen Srom a companion of the understandings of the people oS each nation, who are a more just standard than their Superiors ; their advantages being, more nearly equal, though Sar Srom being perfectly So. The bleffings of a free government,, and the ProteS* tant religion,, are too great and exten-sive Sor any one to judge of all their good and high effects, but by living Sometime in a nation that does not. enjoy them. It is Surprizing, to hear Englishmen (as I have done) approve .and extol the Police oS Paris ; a Police which, by the awe it strikes, Subdues the Spirit, and destroys the Sreedom of conversation, and almost that of thinking : I know it may be Said it only limits the mind on certain Subjects; but are not they the most interesting in nature ? and does not restraint on thefe weaken
the
[ 78 ]
the understanding Sor every other, except the Allard and opera Singers ? The preSent king has nothing to Sear Srom freedom oS Speech, or freedom oS action in his Subjects : in general he is excessively beloved, and the Sew who are discontented and capable of judging, Say, his good qualities are his own, his defects thoSe oS education, and the customs oS his country ; Srom the only quarter he was in danger, the Police was of no uSe ; Sor it did not prevent the affaffination in which the jeSuits were SuppoSed to be concerned. I have heard a Police oS this nature is requisite Sor the Security oS the inhabitants ; but thoSe who imagine there are leSs murders, or other crimes, in this city than London, are much mistaken, or I am misinformed : the custom oS publishing every event in the papers, makes
us
[ 79 ]
B5‘ appear more guilty than our neigti-fcours, who are silent. However, let the Police employ as many Spies as they pleaSe Sor the detection of villains, in this pointit cannot be too industrious; but that an honest country gentleman,, Or any honest man should* be Subject to the Same inquisition,, is highly unreasonable. A perfon affuring me, Society in Paris was much inSerior to what it is in many provincial towns ; added# he never pasted through the street where the Bastile is without Sear, and trembling ; though he always converSed with a reServe,, to which he imputed the insipidity of conversation in this capital.. He is a man of senfe, and. a man of Spirit, truly attached to the king; but a. pique might have deprived him of hist-liberty. I have heard a general complaint it is difficult to be introduced
to-
[ so]
to the best company in Paris: with re- ' gard to certain coteries, no Sashion, however great, is Sufficient ; as iS once strangers were admitted, the freedom of conversation, for which they meet, would be destroyed. As for assemblies in general, a very moderate recommendation will preSent any man who is a gentleman, and will play at cards; and if he will game, no other introduction is requisite, to the greatest and most brilliant company in Paris. La Bruvere’s observation, that the highest genius will not put a man upon a par with thofe who can lose a thousand pistoles upon a card, is quite as true, with regard to these assemblies, at this day, as when he wrote. As to the private coteries, in many there are no cards ; and a perfon must: have wit, or what passes with the company as Such,

I DINED yesterday, in a French houSe, with Some Canadians-; from them I had the pleafure of hearing the highest and most honorable praiSes of my countrymen. It is unneceffary to observe, they were perSons of much understanding and generosity of Sentiment:
, - for those qualities were abfolutely requisite to render justice to a conquering enemy, by whose bravery they had been great fufferers; but every other idea was lost in those of the humanity and politenefs of their conquerors. I have heard a gentleman, who is a good judge, remark, the Canadians are, in general,, myre intelligent than other

French : as far as I am acquainted, the observation is just. A gentleman in company related an event, which demonstrates a man is in danger of losing his liberty in this kingdom, more from the pique or ignorance of inferior ma-
s
gistrates, than the court: it is true, with regard to the former there is generally redreSs ; but a few weeks con-sinement may Sometimes be oS infinite -conSequence. Permit me to give the relation, as I had it from the gentleman who was going ter the waters of Barege for his health. Far advanced in the South, as he was at maSs, Suddenly the church was Surrounded, and he taken priSoner, as an English Spy (it was in time of war): He desired leave to write to the court, or the colonel of the regiment where he was captain. Pen and ink were refuSed, his pockets Searched, G 2	every

every thing oS value Seized. Papers he had none. This confinement might, it is probable, have endured Some months, but a lady came to the inn, where, Sor the preSent, he was confined : the hosteSs told the history, in which the lady found Something was wrong *, being a woman of Spirit, she infisted upon Seeing the priSoner; and, as she was of high rank, the magistrates durst not refuse her ; she, upon entering the room, Saw the gentleman was her countryman : indeed his figure is So truly French, and of what I have beard Some dying English Soldiers, at Fontenoy reproached their adversaries, Soupe maigre. I do not conceive it possible to be Otherwise than a pique, and not a mistake. The lady commanded pen, ink, and paper, in conSe-quence oS his letter, which the lady '	preSented,

preSented; orders came Srom the court, that the gentleman should demand whatever reparations he judged requisite. Though he had Suffered in many points, having lost Several things of value, besides the inconveniency of imprisonment ; yet, to shew he was not actuated by a Spirit oS meer revenge, or interest, he afked nothing for himSelf, but releaSe and reparations to Some poor Protestants, whom this magistrate had most cruelly oppress The gentleman is now retired Srom the Service, with the Croix de St. Louis. I know him very well, and believe he is a man oS honor and truth; and those who are not, are seldom falSe to the dishonor of their country, or countrymen. The king has, within a few years, made a very good order, with regard to these magistrates, who before were perfons of fo G 3	low

I will tell you ; here are Sbme in this kingdom very pretty and agreeable; but the Parisians are not esteemed, by perSons of their own nation, handfbme or well made. The detect, m general, of French faces, is a SameneSs ; 'the variety of character, So striking in English beauties, is unknown here. Un air- hardi, derived Srom much pains, and an idea that modesty and timidity beSpeak a perSon oS mean birth, gives Such a general resemblance, iS you go to an affembly, where there are two hundred women, every one appears oS the Same Samily. They are all lively, or affect that air, which is esteemed So requisite to beauty ; I have heard a woman laugh, when
I have

1 have Seen her cry. Nature, no doubt, gives to the French as great variety of character as other nations; but the part of good breeding, stiled, presenting well, is begun when they are in-- fants, and purfued with fuch assiduity, a child’s countenance, at six years old, is as formed, and can make as many grimaces (for politenefs and affability can be esteemed no better at that age) as the most excellent in this art at thirty in England. I have heard a boy, before he had the habit of a man, tell every woman in the room she was belle comrne l’amour, A lad of fashion complaining, the manner of wearing his hair was infupportable, I advised him to wear it short. Ah ! monsieur, faid he, Je serois bien aise de le faire, mais on dlroit que je n’avois ne sentiment ni honneur, si a mon age je ne G 4	mettois

mettois pas de Pappillotes.—This Sentimental perSon was fifteen ; had never been out of his mother’s or nurse’s houSe, nor had any education, except a little bad Latin, which he catched as he could from an old abbot (his tutor in partibus) when the weather was bad ; for when it was sine, he declared he did not love study. I am far from representing this as a general plan oS French education; neither have I any reaSon to think it very singular : his mother was esteemed a woman d’eSprit, et beau-coup de Scavoir vivre. In an hotel where I once lodged, observing a perSon who appeared So low as a sharper, I was aSraid he should rob me. Upon informing myself, he proved, the tutor and governor oS a sine young man of quality and fortune; he had a pension of two hundred livres: I am certain the valet de
chambre,
[ «9 ]
chambre, by his appearance, had a better appointment. I have heard a gentleman, who is very partial to his country, avow, many a man would give fifty louis a year to a book, who would not make this expence in the education oS his children. You have read frequent exclamations against the English, by our writers, with regard to luxury, and want of domestic attention ; but, thank God, fuch unnatural and abfurd sentiments, as related above, are unknown in England : a Snail reSdence in this country, paS in the examination of manners, will convince how much, in general, we fpend our money better than our neighbours. Now I am upon the fubject of education, I will fpeak a few words upon that of girls, who are of the common rank of noblesse. They are Sent to a convent,
in
[ 9° 3
in a provincial town; where, for a Small pension, they are kept alive, rather than fed. The learning is, Some religion, and much Superstition,, working, and Screaming to music ; instrumental being more expensive, is not So general. The principal instruction of thefe young ladies is, to read, and hear read the lives oS the Saints; upon which, in Some convents, they declame ; thoSe who can determine with the greatest precision, whether St. Catherine, or St. Bridget, &c. had the greatest merit, gain the palm.—This brings to my remembrance an examination which pasted before the great and celebrated pope Lambertini; the Suture bishop was afked, as a knotty point of divinity,, whether the Francifcans, or Benedictine's, or Some other order, no matter whoSe, was the most ancient?' The
examh
[ 91 ]
examiners were going on in this style, when the pope interrupted them, with an ironical air, saying, those were points of too much consequence to be decided in haste ; therefore desired they might be left to the generals of their reSpec-tive orders, who could write more vo-lumes upon the Subject than he had hours to Spare. As I know you are an enemy to flattery, and as I am the Same,
I will not SuppoSe your time equally precious with that celebrated pontiff’s; consequently shall make no apology for having Spoke on Subjects which appear So trivial. I am happy when I can write any thing that deServes your attention : though permit me to fay, | receive more pleaSure from the idea of your partiality, than I could from the greatest advantages, or even Superiori-ty of talents, in the possession of

I HAVE been at VerSailles, a place 1 So well known it is Scarce possible to Say any thing new ; for that reafon I shall not dwell upon the Subject. The facade of the palace to the town, has rather the appearance of a heap of buildings, than the front of one large edifice ; that to the gardens is very handfome : the apartments are extremely fpacious and noble. I was Surry I had not time to examine the paintings,
[ 93 ]
ings So much as I wished. The king passing to hear maSs, I was led by my company to make his Suite. This ceremony is more pleaSing at VerSailles, than any other place where I have at-tended ; as the Service is short, and the music, Sung by an Italian, very fine : at other churches or chapels, they have only music at the grand maSs, which Is too long for thoSe who have no other motive than curiosity. Whenever I am preSent at this ceremony, it is with regret I observe an appearance of Such confined sentiments in Christians, and, in opposition to them, reflect upon those Sublime ideas, which Lucan gives to Cato : Ideas perfectly agreeable to Christianity,
Estque Dei Sedes, ubi terra, et pontus et aer Et coelum, et virtus-------------
Where earth, Sea, air, or heaven is,
God reigns ; and virtue is his throne.

[ 94 ]
It is certain many perSons, of Supe-' rior understanding and sentiments, who are Catholics by profession, do not be-lieve every point taught by the church of Rome. A lady accusing a gentle-man of my acquaintance of not being a good Catholic; he replied, It is true, madam, there may be many better in this city ; but I should be Sorry if this nation, or any other, could boast a more honest man : That he was what he indirectly asserted, in the unlimited Sense of the words, was So notorious, the pride of the Speech was lost in its veracity. The chapel of Versailles is very fine and pretty ; but this is by no means the just praise of a building dedicated to the divinity which ought t0 be in a more Solemn and Sublime style. The celebrated gardens did not anSwer my expectations, my ideas were raised too high : it is common to hear of i	Scenes
[ 95 ]
seenes more beautiful than the imagination, but they exist not in the works of art. A lively imagination paints stronger, and finer, than any human power can execute; he alone who Sormed that Saculty, can SurpaSs it. Here are Some good statues,> and the principal waterworks are worth Seeing: thoSe in the labyrinth are So trifling, I should not have given them a moment’s attention, but Sor the pleafure of observing a child of four years old explain the figures which were perfectly adapted to his age and understanding. These gardens, though large, appear contracted, as their situation does not permit a view beyond them. In general, the English much furpafs the French in this point. A genius for the great and natural, which is distinguishable in many of our writers, is never more requisite than when
we
r 9^ ]
we are forming rural Scenes; as in thoSe art should hide her head, and nature alone appear: correctness and exactitude, the great merit of the French authors, has nothing to do here. There is another 'reafon why the English should SurpaSs this nation in theSe undertakings ; the Sormer oSten delight in a country life; reading and meditation are the voluntary occupations of my countrymen, Scarce ever of the French; the Smallest bourg is to them preSer-able to the finest Seat. I have been told, many of the monks de Char-treux, whose powers oS Speech are limited, turn mad ; it is generally imputed to this cauSe : but as the Same misSortune happens in convents of women, the molt probable reaSon is the general diSagreeableneSs of the situation, How far the latter are Srom
keep:

keeping,Silence every one knows who has visited thoSe houses, and Srom their general reputation on that head. Gref-Set, with great humor, repreSents the Soul of a parrot transmigrated into a nun. Whatever is the cauSe, madneSs, in every Situation oS life, is more common than in England ; which is very astonishing, when one considers how weak their Sentiments are of every kind; but very accountable Srom the strength oS their paffions, which, Sor want of reflection, knows no bounds ; the word Sentiment is ever in their mouth, but never in their hearts, or, if It is, fniss applied. It is unnecessary to observe here, as in many other .places, I fpeak in general terms.

The Chateau de Madrid pleafes from novelty ;■ it was built by Francis the'first, to imitate as well by the interior difpbsition of thuapartments, as by the architecture 'and outward ornaments, the. Chateau, de Madrid,, where he was kept prifo-ner by Charles,the fifth ; how he came, there you are fo good an historian, it: is. not neceffary for me to relate. What, could induce the monarch to erect a palace in commemoration of Such a. dif-agreeable event,, I will not pretend to, determine., It is Laid the imitation is exact as his wishes, even to the little* guard-room. The profpect from the Chateau is very fine. It is now in. possession of the president de Pelletier.

Near the Bois de Boulogne, is the village of Passy, the most pleaSant in France. The gardens, where are the medicinal waters, command a charm-ing proSpect ,of the Seine, Paris, and the environs. I have made Several ex-cursions ; but if-1 find Some pleaSure in seeing a number of palaces, I am ap-prehensive there is too much SameneSs for ypu to receive any from the deScrip-tion ; for this reaSOn I wilil only fay of St. Cloud, it is, in my opinion, pre-ferable to Versailles; as I think Situa-tion more consequential than magnifi-H 3	cence.

cence. Louis Quatorze liked this palace too well; he told his brother, he wished to be his Concierge ; a hint the Duke of Orleans did not chuSc to take. It is amazing, amidst So many sine situations, what could induce that monarch to six upon one So bad as Versailles to display his magnificence; Some Say it was to render the power of the latter more conSpicuous. The Same expence at St. Germains would have made that place one oS the finest in the world. I have heard, the view of St. Denis Srom thenee deterred the king Srom building, and improving St. Germains. He could take no pleasure in a proSpect oS which his Memento mori made a part. This may not be the true reaSon, but appears poS-sible to thoSe who are well acquainted with the French. Their Sears and apprehensions

prehensions of death are most excessive. An elderly lady invited me, with many others, to her tete, which they celebrate on the day oS the patron Saint; from whom they take their name as we do a birth-day : I wished that lady numerous and happy years ; she made no anSwer, a cloud came over her face, of which I did not comprehend the reaSon ; but was aSterwards told, my wish implied a possibility of the contrary, and had by that means shocked her. I have known perSons who appeared to believe all the legends Superstition can teach; yet, upon a strict conversation, they did not diScover tsie least reasonable hope or faith of an immortal life, A sentiment which Fielding gives to Sophia's maid in raillery, I have heard many French serioussy avow, particularly the ladies. It is better to kill all H 4	the

LETTER XIX,
I HAVE been about ten days , at Blois : the inhabitants appear a very Sociable, agreeable people, extremely civil’ to strangers ; particularly Madame de -Baillehache, one of the first perSons, (though here is much ancient noblesse); being English is the highest: introduction to her Society. A great number of Canadians live in this city; I am
acquainted
[ 10 6 ]
acquainted with none except the ladies jpf the Vasiant Samily ; who are very Sensible agreeable women, oS a good houSe in Bretagne. Blois is celebrated for Speaking the best French in the kingdom : Some assert this reputation was acquired Srom the residence oS the court; consequently has no longer a right to that Superiority. If people mean by the best French, the best accent, not only Blois, but all the country d’alentour, has the Same merit. If the richnefs of the language is to be taken into the excellence, I should think University or Parliament towns, being seats of eloquence, have more just pretenfions.. I know fome of the j latter, particularly Rouen, have a bad accent; but it does not affect the rank of people whom strangers frequent,. Those, who compofe the best focictjes,
as
C 107 ]
as the houSe robe, principal clergy, &c, are educated in Paris, the latter at the Sorbonne. Plear the one Speak, and the other preach, I deSy the nicest ear to diScover the Rouennois in their elegant diScourSes : what I know oS this, I imagine of the other Seats oS parliament, particularly of Bretagne; where, from the Spirit of eloquence which dictated their remonstrances, may be Seen how highly they poffefs their language ; and wherever the robe are distinguished, the Same degree of excellence may be expected from the clergy, talents increasing by emula^ tion. It is true, the liberty of parliaments, and the abSolute power oS the Iteman church, are Subjects which form a contrast ; accordingly the parties are always at variance ; but graces Sul elocution, and just diction, are
equally
I 10$ ]
equally employed by both to carry their points.—I have heard an anecdote: which at first Surprized me much *, but upon reflection, apart of my astonishment ceafed j it is, that Madame de Se-vigne hated her daughter, to whom she wrote So many volumes of letters, full of. the most tender affection. I can conceive, a woman may want natural -affection, a child may not merit it, and •decency may oblige people to a certain appearance : but that it is poffible to exprefs So much love where there is So little, I could never have believed, had not thoSe expressions been outrees : they appeared to me ridiculous before I heard this anecdote, and now contemptible, The Sentiments and expressions of nature, may equal or SurpaSs in force thoSe of the passions, but never can have the ridicule which Sometimes attends
f 109 J
sends the latter ; and Sure, for a mother to compliment a daughter on her beauty, has So great a degree of folly, if she is not a fool (as Madame de Se-vigne certainly was not) it must proceed from Some extraordinary motive ; though disiike to a daughter, at least,, if one may judge from the ill treatment of them, can Scarce be called So here. Of the numbers of girls who are forced into convents, there are many merer from the cruelty of mothers than fathers. If Madame de Sevigne had the understanding Some people give her*
' she was not only a general contradiction, to the world, in general, but a particular one to the French with whom I am acquainted;, who are artful in the Same degree they are weak, and wise as they are sincere. It is uiineceffaTy to* fay this, observation- regards only common
t 110 ]
mon life; in politics I am not conversant ; there I SuppoSe all may deScend to art. If this anecdote is falSe, it comes Srom the French; who are, in general, interested in the reputation of their writers; and one would hope envy nor Scandal could not live So long after the perSon it regards is dead. But in contrast to this defect in family affection, which I cannot mySelf affirm, I will give the history of a domestic heroine (though in another kind) the truth oS which I can aver. An officer, who had Served Several years with distinction and reputation, Sent to desire his wife to join him at Brest, to go to the West Indies, where his regiment was commanded; she immediately complied, though in a Situation which rendered Such a voyage dangerous. Imagine then her distrefs, when arriving at
i Brest,
t III 1
' Brest, she found her hushand confined by a pique oS his Colonel, and dishonored, by being cashiered without the uSual reward of long. Service, the Croix de St. Louis ; the pension annexed is inconsiderable, but though the order is common, the high point oS honor attached to it, is beyond the conception of an Englishman, at least, a wiSe one, who rests his reputation upon Something more Solid than the court can give, or the pique of a courtier prevent. The lady conSulted the officers whom justice interested in the honor of her hushand : they advifed, if possible, to get to VerSailles before the Colonel, who had that day Set out to haveJ his proceedings ratified ; after which they are seldom changed or cor= j rected. Finding no . chaise, the lady took post horfes, and puriued her jour-
ney
f *12 1
fiey with Such Spirit, night and day, she presented her petition to the Dauphi-neSs ; it was granted, and she1 met the Colonel entering the palace oS Versailles as she quitted it. I had the pleafure of dining with this happy couple when the above-written event was related. If is impossible to expreSs the Satisfaction and .pleaSure which appeared in the gentleman’s countenance, nor his fond-nefs Sor a wife and only child, whoSe lives had been rifqued for the Sole caufe cn earth that could be put in competition with them : they have little more than a hundred a year: love formed their Union. I could not but remark Such a singular instance of conjugal affection, 'in a nation where a moderate degree css this virtue is rare. You will hot wonder It is fb, when I tell the •manner in which marriages, in general, 3	are
[ ”3 ]
are contracted. The gentleman pays a visit to the lady, who is at the other side of the grate ; in that Situation every man is charming: it Saves the exertion of paternal authority, and the assiduity oS a lover. The conSequences of thefe unions are what might be expected ; the lady efcaped from her Confinement, places her happinefs in repairing lost time, by living in public ; and her hushand, whom she could not be faid to chuSe, she seldom approves. Compliments, which have only their just value with those who have lived and been educated in the world, turn the brain, and make the blifs of a perfon to whom they are entirely new. The honor of a deliberate distinction is, I flatter myself, that of, Madam,

O N the road from Blois to Orleans,., is the charming Seat oS Madame de Pompadour’s brother, now MonS. de Menard, Srom the name oS this Chateau. The fashion of taking the title. oS an estate, which the French do, whether it comes by inheritance or pur-chaSe, makes them change their appellations three or Sour times in their lives. This custom confessed me extremely when I. sirst came into France; Sor I imagined every perSon of the family whoSe name was their distinction. Seeing a MademoiSelle de Courtenay, I concluded she was oS that houSe, one of, the sirfc in France ; but I Sound she was only called So from a little piece of
ground,w
[ H5 ]	'
ground, to avoid being distinguished by her Christian name ; which none, who are or would be esteemed perSons of fashion, will permit. The great, Srom their different estates, are easily Supplied with distinctions ; but I have known thoSe who were poor,and of inferior rank, and yet would ape them ; obliged to a gooseberry-bush, or a cherry-tree, for their title. Orleans is a large town, but very little good company. The ca- -thedral is very hanelSome, to which considerable additions are making, a great Sum being appropriated to that uSe. The bridge lately built is very sine, but not equal to Westminster. The French are very fond of a Bon mot Said with regard to this edifice. A perfon finding it, as he thought, very defective in point of strength, and declaring his opinion, was anSwered, Cela I 2	n’eSt
f n6 ]
n’est pas vrai, car il a Soutena le plus grand poids de la France, Madame de Pompadour est paffee parla hier. The Rue Royale, which leads to the bridge, is very handSome : the Sronts of the houSes are built by the king, any perSon may buy one, and finish the remainder oS the dwelling to his taste. This uniSormity has a beautiSul effect, the facades being compleat to the bridge, which leading to the planted road makes the point of view perfectly sine. In the chapel oS the Benedictins, there are what the people call paintings, but they really do not deServe that title. The tapestry has much better pretensions from the appearance; one must go very near to be undeceived. The Benedictins are esteemed an order who have fome learning, particularly in history ; but a Monkish history is generally too
partial
[ n7 ]
partial to be very valuable. However, nothing can be Said against: this order in particular, except their poffeffing great riches, which might be employed to better purpoSes. It is certainly very unjust, perSons who are a dead weight upon the public, should have more wealth than they can sind means to Spend; when an officer, who has ventured his liSe for the Service oS his king and country, as well as Spent the little fortune he received Srom his family, has only Sour hundred livres a year, about Seventeen or eighteen pounds sterling: I know Some who have but this pension Sor their Support, and perSons oS very good family.-------1 was

pany was in general good, but the principal actor by no means equal to Ins part. I have Seen this play »at the Duke de Noailles, when the Duke d’Ayen, Madame de Teffay, and Madame de Noailles represented the first __ characters. Madame de Teffay played the coquet with equal Spirit and elegance ; Madame de Noailles the prude’, with as great justnefs ; and their sine figures infinitely heightened the merit of their performance. But I cannot fay the Duke fucceeded fo well in the character. of this piece, as I have heard he does in many others ; nor is it astonishing a Mifanthrope should not be found, whoSe politeneSs, hoSpitality and gaiety

may not be in So high perfection as many others, yet I never See this play without admiration, and read it with
yet

-yefgreater. The SenSe is So sine and strong, one wishes to dwell longer upon % • each word than acting will permit. We have no comedy of equal Sorce in my opinion: indeed, Sor the number and exquisite humor of his works, he bears the palm from every comic writer, In tragedy, I think, the Superiority is in-^ diSputably the right of the English ; though the French are far from acknowledging this point’: but I can never agree they are judges of what it is Scarce possible they Should understand. Hearing a gentleman criticiSe and murder Shakefpear, I expressed my Sentiments as Sar as politeneSs would permit : He Said, Why might not he comprehend ShakeSpear, as well as the English Racine ? the anSwer was a demonstration he had no idea oS our great, poet ; who is not perfectly understood 1 4	by

by perSons oS his own nation, who will not study him; nor by all that do, is plain Srom Some of his commentators. Shakefpear’s language, and the variety oS characters, which are many oS them English; add to theSe in his comedies, the humor are all inSuperable difficulties to a stranger. As to Racine, his style is eaSy, and his characters being ancient, Soreign, and, in general, tragic, are as well known to us as the Ictench : They generally preSer Racine to Corneille ; in which, as in many points, I differ Srom them.

In conSequence of this decision we went to Briare : from Orleans to Chateauneuf / nothing appears worthy attention. The Count de St. Florentin is Seigneur of this place ; he has a houSe and gardens in a situation very uncommon Sor a minister’s : they are Sailing into ruins. From the Count’s Seat, which is not worth Seeing, we went to the church, where we had better SucceSs. There is a sine monument of Monk de Louvois, prime minister to Louis Quartorze ; it i	is
[ 122 ]
is a Roman perSormance : nothing can be more noble than the figure of MonS. de Louvois, in which consists the beauty of the whole, the ornaments not beino considerable. The French, tho* it was early, choSe to dine at Chateau-neuS, as this place is celebrated for good eating. I had always heard, and 'did believe, Sor Some time, Society made the principal part in the pleaSures of a table in France ; but a residence in this •country has convinced me of the contrary : when they can indulge in Seasting, without taking Srom the expence ' of their figure in other points, they do.; ! and when abstemious, it is Srom love ; oS parade. It is an odd assertion, but 1 ' i I think faffing makes gluttons : De- i vots and Devotees, are in general So. Drinking is certainly much leSs common than in England ; but, upon the

I know a Frenchman who eat two dozen of ortolans Sor forty livres, a pint of bad wine for' ten Sols : An Englishman, perhaps, would have reversed the expence. From what I have Said on this Subject, as well as on Some others more effential, you will, it is posilble, accuse me of partiality to my country : I promise, it shall not make me deviate from truth ; and for the rest, a man cannot have too much for that nation to whole preservation and prosperity he ought to be ready

arrived at Briare after passing a very barren country : in this place we had nothing to examine but the canal, which, though a very valuable and curious work, would not be entertaining in the description. The province '	of
[ 124]
of Berry, through which we passed to the Nivernois, is a very plentiful country, but the people very poor ; the latter and the former, in Some degree, proceeds from the difficulty of transporting the produce of this into other provinces. The gentry are much diS-treffed ; but the most shocking fight I ever Saw in this refpect, was a gentleman travelling in la Beauce, walking with his wife, who was barefooted : he had, as they called it, deroged, by marrying his Servant; yet, as by his figure no Superiority appeared, except that derived from his Sword, Shoes and stockings, in which he could not make her his equal, I do not Sec there was any great harm done ; Sor I imagine they were upon a par as to Sentiments, the most effential point in Such an union ; he having been born to this exceSs of
poverty
[ 125 ]
poverty it was not possible he could have received a common French education ; as long as a family can be brought up with any degree oS decency and knowledge, a man does right to keep the advantages oS nobleffe; a moderate Sortune gained in trade, beino-Sar Srom compensating what may be lost in rendering Sons incapable of the many lucrative honors attached to high birth, and daughters oS great alliances. I am acquainted with a man oS quality and vast fortune, who, going to make a residence at an estate he had never Seen, called upon art old Sriend of his Sather’s ; when entering the court, he was So highly struck and charmed with the beauty oS a young woman who was washing, that, in a moment, he was deSperately in love ; as he approached, she ran away : this circumstance, and •	a know-
[ 126 ]
a knowledge of the gentleman’s poverty, made him hope it was the daughter of a friend ; he was not mistaken, and married her without the least hesitation, which he would not have done the greatest fortune who had net the fame birth : As Sor education, it was probably better than if her parents had been more at their eaSe ; Sor, in general, amongst the women I have known, t.hoSe are most agreeable who have been educated at home. A gentleman, the eldest of ten children, told me, they entered the world with no other advantage than a good name. They are all very considerable at preSent. I do not ’ Say thefe events are Srequent, but enough So to prove we should not wonder (as I have heard Some English) and blame the French nobleffe, because they do not engage in trade upon the

least glimpse of poverty. What is right, and perhaps requisite in one System of government, may be wrong in another. It is most certain, before they arrive at the degree of misery with the poor gentleman I first mentioned, they would do well to quit that state from which they can receive no advantage; not being in a situation to affociate with their fuperiors, they have no chance ofraising; their fortune. What is a much greater" inconvenience to the nation than the nobleffe not entering into commerce,, those who are in that situation will not continue a moment after they can live idle. A Bourgeois being a step above a Merchant, by this means businefs is never well understood, nor carried on with any advantage. Many English have an idea none but gentlemen are-adrpitted into the army ; yet not only

the marching regiments, but in the gardes de corps, during the late war, Some others were admitted ; the court was glad to receive any rank that could bear the expence, the pay not being anSwerable to the figure required ; and thoSe who have honor already, will not purchaSe an addition at So dear a rate, as others an entire acquisition. The service has every advantage but riches ; even the lowest Soldier finds a Superior protection from the court; of which, the hollowing circumstances are a proof.
A Protestant Soldier died ; the commanding officer ordered him to be buried ; the priest refufed to do his duty ; a guard was Set about the grave, the man put into it, and the priest commanded to let him rest till an anfwer , came Srom court : the order arrived, in theSe words, Said to be the King’s :

“ I know but one religion in my king-1 “ dom, and my Soldier shall be honor-“ ably and decently interred.” It is unnecessary to obferve the clergy Submitted. Whether this was his Ma-jesty’s decision or not, I have heard Some which certainly were; and inclined me to think, had as much pains been taken to make him wiSe and virtuous as the contrary, he would not have been very deficient in any reSpect. I am afraid I write on many Subjects not amusing ; but you commanded my Sentiments as they aroSe, and they must depend upon the Society with whom I am connected, and the circumstances before me ; unlels you would have' the whole letter to consist of my principal idea, the esteem with which I am, Madam,

NlVERS, the capital oS Niver-nois, has a very handfome entrance, by a sine gate; as have most cities in France a In which reSpect this, and many others^. may be compared to the mountain and the mouSe; Sor, except a sine view Srom the bridge, every part of the town is bad The, architect has. particularly difplayed the fociable disposition of his country ; Sor you may give hands,and embrace from the opposite windows. All the remark I can. make upon the cathedral is, the images are So numerous, and placed in Such a style about the choir, the inhabitants may from thence acquire a repu-, tatjon of perpetual devotion.;. I started
back
[ *3' ]
back at first sight, not being willino- to interrupt So Serious an occupation in others, to Satisfy my curiosity. Ni- , vernois is a fine province, as is the Bourbonnois ; the capital oS the latter is Moulins, a tolerable well-built town. The Cour de Berci is esteemed the finest in France ; it is very large, and beautiSully planted ; but I think the Cour at Rouen more pleasing, as there is a greater variety in the view. In the convent of St. Mary is a Superb monument of the last Duke of Mont-morenci, who was beheaded at Thou-louSe in the reign oS Louis Treize. When at a distance Srom the capital, nothing eScapes that merits attention. ThoSe I have mentioned are the only objects which deServe to interrupt a
1 journey for a moment.------The little
barren province du Forest Seems placed
K 2	by
/
[ 132 ]
by nature to give a higher relief to the beautiful country oS the Beaujolois and Lyonnois; they cannot be Surpaffed: The hills covered with vines and olives, the vallies with the richest pasture ; and in the Corsitain, the lofty mountains of Auvergne form a fcene to which my pen is by no means adequate. TheSe pleasing proSpects, added to a Society well compofed, have rendered my journey very agreeable. The French are, in general, good travelling companions ; Soon acquainted, and have a knowledge uSeSul Sor the occalion ; hif-tories oS families, provinces, &c. They have one fubject, with which I am more than fatissied; this is the King’s a- • tnours. The French are fo dazzled with royalty, every action of a King appears interesting. As for Madame de Pompadour, she made herself con-*	sequential;
[ 133 ]
Sequential; but, in general, no more is to be Said of one woman the King loves than of another. I have related one affair as it was attended with particular circumstances, the Same reaSon engages me in the following. Perhaps it may be neceffary to premiSe, though (to the honor oS the court) lettres de cachets are not So easily obtained as they were Sometime since ; yet, at preSent, by them perSons may be confined, without trial, not only on ministerial affairs, but by their relations, and are So on various Subjects and pretences. A lady had shut up her father in one oS theSe Maifons de Force ; Sometime after the King happened to take a fancy to her: A perSon, who did not chooSe she should have So high a rank as the King’s mai-treffe en titre is here esteemed, told him of the above-mentioned affair, which ' K 3	had
£ 134 ]
had the desired effect; his Majesty never afterwards treating her with any distinction. Odd enough, that virtue of any kind should be requisite for Such a situation. Perhaps a more effectual method could not be taken to encourage filial piety ; oS which, and every family sentiment, prance appears to have lefs than England ; but the royal house is, in general, distinguished for this merit. The King was many years a very attached and fond hushand. ,What must be the strength and blindness of that passion which made him fay, whenever a handfome woman was mentioned, Is she as handfome as my Queen ? who is, without exception, the plainest perfon in Europe. This sentiment continued fo long, it would probably have been as lasting as life, had not the Qlieen’s mistaken devotions
rendered
[ 135 ]
Tendered her incapable of entertaining him ; his Majesty must be entertained, and does not diflike being governed. The Queen had as little inclination for-government as the King; she threw Jherself into the hands of the priests ; he Sell into thoSe of a mistreSs. You will, perhaps, think I have wandered from the Subject of the King’s amours; pardon me, however unuSual a circumstance it may be in this kingdom, there is reaSon to -think he never loved any woman but his Wife ; though, by the assiduity of others, he-is connected with them, as the Queen preferred her devotions to his Majesty’s Society, Coffee is her passion, though she likes the pleaSures oS the table in general; having once, as a penance, ceaSed to drink that liquor, she was So miserable, as to be obliged to desist from a fcheme K 4	which
[ i36 ]
which appeared to her very meritorious. ASter what I have Said, it is unnecessary to add, she is a very weak woman ; yet site has many great qualities : Compaf-sionate, affable, charitable, and generous. Virtues that are incontestable. To which she adds, in the highest perfection, all thoSe whoSe existence is derived Srom the religion she proSeffes. You will not be Sorry the post is going out, and obliges me to conclude,
Madam,
Lyons.

LETTER XXIV.
The situation oS Lyons is extremely beautiful and advantageous. The
rivers
[ i37 ]
rivers Soane and Rhone are great ornaments, and contribute to render it the most rich and commercial city in France. This place Supplies with manufactures not only the whole king- ■ dom, but Italy and Spain ; the latter have their dreffes, as well as silks, made here. The place de Bel cour Surpasses, in many refpects, any in Paris, except that of Louis Quinze : this place has a beautiSul shady walk, and though in the midst of the town, has a view into the country : The hills, covered with the rich fruits oS this province, rising into an amphitheatre above the tops oS the houSes, have a most plea-sing effect. The quay is very hand-Some, the ramparts are an agreeable walk, and command a sine proSpect. You See the situation oS the town is charming; but I should never chooSe a
long
I 138 ]
long residence in Lyons, the Society being far from desirable. The inhabitants are almost all des gens parvenus ; very little true noblesse. It is very eafy, when riches are acquired, to pur-chale offices which give the rank of gentlemen; but the sentiments by which they are distinguished, are beyond all price. Honor and politenefs are the general attendants on high birth ; how far others may be inferior to those who have this advantage in the first of these qualities, my acquaintance with the gentilhomme Bourgeois, is too flight to determine with justice ; but a day is fufficient to see in the latter
they bear no comparifon.------This city
has a good theatre, concerts, &c. The women have very little beauty, but endeavour to Supply that defect by dreSs, which, in general, Succeeds with
French-
[ *39 ]
Frenchmen; une belle Semme, et une Semme bien miSe, being almost Synonymous terms. The Duke de Villeroi is governor of this town, but Seldom resident. The intendant and commandant receive company. The com-manderie is joined to the prevot des mar-chands; consequently the commandants are of a rank inSerior to thoSe in other cities. A gentleman oS my acquaintance observing a perSon in that office, who had but an indifferent appearance, afked if he was of condition. The perSon he addreffed, anSwered, II est un gentilhomme comme cela. I think none should be defpil'ed for their birth, but thofe who are inSolent Srom their riches ; a defect very general in all the French who acquire fortunes by com-merce: In England, the Succefs being more common, is Supported with a better 3	grace.-
L iqo ]
grace. The inhabitants cf Lyons are not So ignorant as in Some parts of France; they would not be Surprised to hear the children in Rome Speak Italian, as was one of their countrymen, who being . anSwered, Do not children in France Speak French ? Said, Perdie, parle Francois, tout le monde parle Francois. The great commerce oS this city obliges the Lyonnois to be connected, and Sometimes to travel into Soreign countries ; which gives a great Superiority to many provincial towns, and, being the route to Italy, brings many strangers. At a Supper where I was preSent, added to Several very intelligent perSons oS this place, there were two Italians of high Sashion and agreeable Society. The perSons one meets abroad are generally Superior to thofe at home; as it is that Superiority which gives an
incite
[ Hi ]
inclination for Sarther knowledge. It is only the English, who Srequently visit Soreign nations without any other motive than Salhion. The upper rank oS people in Lyons, keep very great and elegant tables, Surpassing any I have yet Seen in a provincial town. Wine and all provisions, are in equal abundance and perfection. One circumstance, in the manner oS living in this city, is very low and mean : PerSons oS great Sortune let out different parts oS the houSes they inhabit : I am in that of a gentleman who makes a considerable figure ; here are three or Sour Samilies, besides the perSon of whom I hire my part. A French gentleman, who thinks he understands Eng-lish, and the customs of the nation, shewed me a lady at the play, and pointing to her with great derision, Saif
she
[ H2 ]
she was quite a toast; what he understood by that word, I cannot better explain to you than in Saying, it regarded her character (not her perSon); which was the reverSe oS hers, to whom I have the honor of being
Lyons.	A most, obedient, &c.

I W A S paying a visit to an English lady yesterday, when an event happened, which made me laugh at the time ; though it has since given rise to

Elle les revendent a Paris, ce qui lui donne lseccasion de Se trouver toujours dans la fbciete brillante. I am perSuaded, when you read what I have wrote, So Sar from
believing
[ *44 T '	.
believing it truth, you will think the' ridicule outree. Not in the least, I af-Sure you ; 1 have So little of that talent, I could not have imagined any things So ridiculous. The lady, I was visiting fiiys she knew one of thefe girls, who, not having the gout, and Sentiment requisite to arrange the head of a merchant’s wife at Lyons, had the good Sortune to acquire a considerable pension Sor Sorming the minds and manners of a whole family oS Englifh children. TheSe events, addeel the lady, are not very common, or we fiiould have no pretension to deSpiSe the lowest French education ; Sor with them Sobriety and the Same religion, are always requisites: not but I grant there are French women of honor to whom children, not to be educated in their principles, might be confided, but they are few; and being .
people
[ 145 ]
people of birth and education, though distressed fortune, their mcdesiy, So Sar from preventing, leads them to a retirement, where not many will Seek their merit to reward it : theSe were the lady’s observations. Are not you, Madam, Surprized the English fliould make Such a point oS learning the French language ? ThoSe who cannot Support the expence of a gouvernante, Sometimes Send their children to starve in a convent; but they starve a la FrancoiSe. Mr. Locke thought too much was rifqued to accomplish men'in the finest languages: What would he have Said where the rifque is So much greater, and the acquisition So much leSs. I grant the languages are ornaments, when they can be acquired without any hazard of effential qualifications. A woman may not only sill every duty in Vol. I,	L	life
[ M 1
life (that no one can dispute) but, ar the Same time, make a most elegant figure in her family, and Society in general ; yet have no idea of any language but her own. Amongst many, I had the particular honor oS one lady’s acquaintance, who was So highly distinguished for her wit, knowledge, and Social virtues ; at a time when the charms of her Sex could no longer add to thoSe of her conversation* both Sexes,, all ages, and the greatest geniuSes in England, courted her Society; to the agreement oS which they were as Sensible as the French, to what they call Bel eSprit ; this they honor to Such a degree, I have Seen a woman of Seventy charm a whole assembly by this quality, when a beautiful perfon, in the bloom of youth, could not attract the notice of a gentleman who fat next her, he declaring,,
[ 147 ]
daring, as the King, when a lady was preSented, whoSe beauty was her greatest excellence, C’est une belle bete. His Majesty is not celebrated Sor genius ; but he is a Frenchman, consequently, wit, or what amuSes as Such, is by him preferred to beauty. I do not agree with this nation in the extraordinary homage they pay to a brilliant understanding, as I think great efforts to shine in this light frequently deftroys more effential merits, particularly in your Sex, Madam. Modesty and good nature may render a woman happy, and all thoSe who are connected with her; but every other quality combined, cannot compenSate a deficiency in theSe. Do not imagine what I have Said proceeds Srom a desire of limiting the understanding of women ; no, I only wish them, to acquirct true knowledge, in JL 2	which
[ 148 J
which every advancement is a progrefe towards virtue, vice proceeding frequently Srom ignorance. IS people could be convinced virtue would make them more happy than vice, which is a certain truth, and that every deviation from the Sormer, is a step to misery, none could purSue the latter. Virtue is the first requisite to happineSs, but to ' Say
Virtue alone makes happineSs below,
cannot be true, unlds it was universal; in the preSent state of the world,, it is talking to children, and to them improperly ; because it is not exact truth .: Experience will convince this doctrine is in fome degree false ; from thence they may judge it is entirely So. When we assert virtue will greatly heighten the bliSs of the most happy sts.te, and
as
[ H9 1
as much alleviate the pain oS the most distrest, we Speak to reaSon and truth, them we should ever addreSs : violent rhapSodies may affect the passions for a moment, but never can direct our actions to constant and uniform virtue. I beg pardon Sor this digression, to a perSon whoSe liSe is a more/ pleasing lesion of every kind oS merit, than any one can give, with the highest reSpect Sor that merit, and the most sincere attachment to the excellencies which attend it, I am,

T H E Cathedral of Lyons has nothing worthy remark ; Sor I do not esteem the clock in that light. The canons are stiled Comtes de Lyons, and rank as Such; they are distinguished by an order, which hangs upon the breast, by a ribband round the neck. They must prove Seven generations of noblesse, by the father’s side ; which is much easier than the seize quartiers, though farther back : Several of them ajppear to be of Bretagne, where there is much ancient noblesse. Near this city is a house of Royal Chanoinesses; the* fame proofs of birth are required for their admission as the canons. They are educated for this fcheme of life
very
. I i5i ]
very young, but do not engage 'by vows till twenty-five; before that time they are at liberty to marry ; and when the engagement is made, they do not fpend their lives like other religious orders : they visit, rgo to concerts, and all a-muSements, as women of the world, except the theatre ; which the confess Sors prohibit to the Sex, though they are not attended to oSten in this point. Some fortune is requisite to thefe ladies, as they do not live in the common style of convents : those houses, in general, afk a certain Sum ; but the humor of being nuns declines fo fast, if they were not frequently received without a shilling, monasteries would be very empty : It is faid Paris has two hundred leSs than it had fome years since. If they were not convenient prifons for the children of the poor L 4	noblesse.
[ 152 ]
noblesse, and their inferiors, who ape the manners of a rank to which they have no pretenfions, convents would Soon be Suppreffed ; the government appearing much inclined to make a better difpofition of their vast wealth. Wherever there are leSs than eight in a houSe, the monasticks are obliged to join in another which is not compleat, and the revenues are Seized Sor the public. It will be much Sor the public good if the preSent King should reign many years longer ; he, the parliament, and court in general, are inclined to weaken the power of the clergy; but they, by their influence over the people, oblige their adversaries to take almost imperceptible steps to carry the point in view. At the Petit Souper the Subject of conversation was the Pope’s power : the Dauphin
declared,
[ 153 ]
declared, he So highly honoured that authority, were he Seated upon the throne, and commanded by his holi-neSs to resign, he should obey. Then, Said the King, by the Same authority, Sir, I SuppoSe you would uSurp it to-. morrow, if you had an opportunity, and immediately ordered the Dauphin to withdraw, and banished him the preSence Sor ten days : a punishment, where the tenderneSs of a father prevailed over the power andjealoufy of a King.
I was last night at the tragedy of * Titus and Berenice ; the language and sentiments of this piece are, in general, pleasing, but rather too languishing for the great character of Titus : He might, and I fuppose did, love as well as a lefs hero; yet we have been fo accustomed to think of him in a
distin-
[ *54 ]
distinguished and public light, it is impossible to approve oS this addon being finguiarized as the Subject of a poem, -with whatever circumstances it might be attended,; two lines in this piece, which I have heard often quoted, do not appear to me So high a compliment as they are generally esteemed.
Depuis cinq ans entiers je la vois
Et crois toujours la voir pour la premiere fois.
A beloved perSon, who is fuch as Berenice is deScribed, attaches to So great -a degree by long acquaintance, the pleafure received from the first view of the most perfect beauty, must be faint, compared to the fatisfaction and happi-nefs of seeing her. You find, Madam, I am willing to grant Titus might love to a greater height than Racine represents, I am perSuaded, he did; as
strength
[ 155 ]
strength and constancy of sentiment are general attendants on Superiority of genius.------In the tragedy of Britannicus,
love might very well make a principal action ; it was natural to that prince’s Situation, and age, as advanced by Racine. The following lines are expref-five, just, and natural, when Nero questions Narcissus, Whether he really thinks the young prince loves ? the courtier anfwers like a perfon accustomed, as he was, to observe and study the countenances, and from thence judge the difpositions of mankind :
«
je l’ai vu quelque fois s’arracher de ces lieux Le coeur plein d’un courroux qu’il cachoit a
vos yeux
D’une cour qui le fuit pleurant l’ingratitude, Las de votre grandeur, et de Sa Servitude, Entre 1’impatience et la crainte flottant;
II alloit voir Junie et revenoit content.
In
[ A ]
In the state oS Britannicus love alone could produce the effect So well described, and in So Sew words, a merit which is not oSten Racine’s, his SenSe being frequently finished beSore the line. This piece, and Some others, ' are So good upon the whole, it would be unpardonable to Seek Sor little defects, which, perhaps, are unavoidable in numerous compositions. I shall Set out for Avignon to-morrow, as early after my arrival, as I can have an opportunity oS examining what deServes attention ; I will communicate my Sen-ments, and have the pleaSure of Saying, I am,
Madam,
Lyons

F ROM Lyons we dined at Con-drieu ; where I think we had the most
t
excellent and cheapest repast I ever yet beheld ; the advantages oS the country are, in this reSpect, lost, when English travel alone. Our own party consisted of two English and three French ; to which we added three or Sour more Sor the dining company. A bill oS Sare is not, very amusing; but this was So extraor?- ‘ Vot. II.	B	dinary,

We had the wine of this place, which pleases me beyer than any other in France. Two ladies, who had drank none of that liquor since they left Paris, were content with le vin de Condrieux. We paid but eighteen pence a head English money, and the gentleman who managed our affairs, Said at the table d’hote, with the Same Sare they were still cheaper.— The rapidity of the Rhone is So notorious, any remarks I could make on that head would be too trite to de-Serve reading. When the boat passed

This edifice has nothing extraordinary, but great length, to which the breadth bears no proportion ; nor has it any beauty, except what is derived Srom the idea of its utility. The rapidity of the river might occasion fome difficulties ; yet, as they have been Surmounted in fo many different places, one cannot make them the Subject of wonder. We had .

is very beautiful, the town is Small, the ramparts are singularly handfome. This city is the reSort oS much ancient nobleffe, whoSe fortunes are not large enough to make Paris their winter residence. I know fcarce any provincial town where there are fo many sine hotels. The fociety, Ham told, is very good. This city being the Pope’s, is full of convents and clergy, who make more beggars than the benevolence of the bishops can assist, though very great. The charity of the Roman Catholic religion is like breaking a man’s leg, B 3	and

and then relieving the consequent diS-treSs. The Penitens Gris have a chapel here ; ,which pleaSes me more than any thing of the fame kind I ever beheld. The building has three divisions, going through two chapels to the principal; where is the perpetual adoration du Saint Sacrament. The manner in which the altar is Illuminated and decorated, has Something more imposing, and strikingly Solemn, than can be conceived : It is impossible to enter this edifice without a certain degree of reve-. rence. The whole building, though 'very Small, is perfectly well adapted to its uSe. A poor old man was prostrate beSore the altar, performing with great zeal the mistaken duties of the place. The Catholics assert, they haye the Same right to the proSeffion of their re-i	fission.

The proceffion of the feast du Saint Sacrament, is very Splendid and striking in large towns', where there is a cathedral, and the religious orders very numerous. I once read an advertisement on that occasion, which appeared very extraordinary :
“ The angels are desired to attend “ precifely at six o’clock.”
To explain this, children are dreffed according to the French idea of angels, B 4	with
[ 8 ]
with much riband, gold, silver, &c. and walk to heighten the dignity of the procefiion. t You have only to See the feast of St. Nicolas, and cease wondering the people are fo much attached to a religion which gives them, in fome dioceses, sixty or seventy days of mirth, music and dancing, befides funday; where the bishops are fo wise as to abridge their holidays, that their children may have bread ; every storm which blast the vines, or other public ill, is imputed to his defect in veneration for the faints. Some company called upon me this afternoon, to go with them to see the Dutchefs de Cril-lon’s hotel (as to the Duke, I fcarce ever heard him mentioned); it is a sine house, but has nothing singular enough to deserve a visit : in the hall is a large picture, an original, in which
.is

is represented Henry the Sourth, and many oS his courtiers; amongst these personages is distinguished, as you may imagine, the Duke de Crillon; you are not unacquainted with his great and noble character: that monarch had Several perSons in his court whom nature Seemed to have Sormed Sor his friends and companions ; how great a number of his fubjects were unworthy fuch a reign ! witnefs his death, by the thirty-sixth confpiracy, when he was planning fchemes for the aggrandisement and happineSs of his people. In the apartment of the Dutcheis is a Magdalen much esteemed, by Guido; in another is a picture of Mademoiselle de Crillon, who is extremely pretty, but has taken the veil in the severe order of the Carmelites, where they are not per-i	mitten
[ 10 ]
mined to See the nearest relation, without an expreSs order from the bishop of the dioceSe. The French assure me, the fashion oS forcing children into convents declines every day ; I believe it •may; but I know So many instances,
• as are very striking to an English person ; Sor a very Small part of what hap-- ' ■ pens in this kingdom can come within the knowledge of a stranger, particularly oS that kind. As to the young lady abovementioned, her state may be voluntary, for aught I can Say to the contrary : what is very odd, I have heard the Severe orders are more fre-' quently So than others. The family de Crillon did live in a very magnificent •style ; at preSent she has only the petit Souper, and receives none who are not particularly presented. From this hotel

BeTWEEN Avignon and NiSmcs I Saw a most extraordinary piece of architecture, Pont du gard. It is an ancient work of the Romans, more curious than beautiful.. I can only tell you, there are three bridges, one upon another ; I have a print gives a better idea, which, you will fay, is very poS-Sible. NiSmes has- Some sine antiquh-ties ; an amphitheatre,. fuppofed to be built about the time oS Trajan: it is-esteemed in higher preservation than any now remaining. I cannot possibly give Such a description of this edifice as it merits ; I never beheld any So pro-digiousty vast : Srom thence is derived^ the magnificence which, attends this edifice*
[ 14 ]
fee, for it is of the Tusean ordef. ‘Here are feats for twenty thoufand people. The Goths have made their utmost efforts to destroy this noble monument of antiquity. Charlemagne gave the last great shock ; but there are yet remains which testify the Romans built as they wrote, for eternity ; it being impossible to look at this fur-prising work without an idea, had no enemy attacked but time, like Horace, this edifice might have desied his power. From the amphitheatre I went to see the maifon quarree, as it is vulgarly called ; a building as distinguishable for elegance and beauty, as the other for vastnefs and strength : It is a Roman temple, built by Augustus, to the memory of his grandfbns,' Lucius and Agrippa^ The portico and pillars, which Support the architrave, are of the
Corin-
[ i5 ]
Corinthian order ; the chapiters are reversed, which one would think should have an odd effect ; but all here is beauty, elegance, and exqulfite proportion. This piece of antiquity yields to none, except the Pantheon at Rome. It is to be lamented they have not, as Sar as possible, preserved the interior form of the temple, being made into a chapel for the Auguftines has changed it much : However, one cannot look at the exterior without having the moft elevated idea oS the whole. I could not perfuade mySelS to quit this edifice, blit by a resolution to revisit what has So highly charmed me. I have a passion for prints, becauSe they give a more perfect idea than words can, of the antiquities which engage my attention, and make you, in Some degree, a companion of my travels. The fountain
of
[ 16 ]
of Nifmes is a most charming place r The foundations and aqueduct, are modern, the work of the Romans, who may be traced wherever they have been masters, by their great and ufeful undertakings. tThe plantations, and other decorations are modern. At this place is an ancient temple, faid to be dedicated to Diana ; a point not easily afcertained, nor do I see it is of any consequence to the merit of the building, which, in my opinion, is not equal to the general estimation. The ruins are fuch, antiquarians are obliged to imagine the beauties they defcribe; these gentlemen certainly understand better than others the detail of the excellencies and particular circumstances regarding the monuments of antiquity; but where there is nothing in an edisice which strikes and Speaks for itself, as
great
[ 17 ]
great or beautiful, I cannot place it in a very high rank. A little distance from this temple is an ancient grand tower, built by the Gauls. I shall not enter into a difpute concerning its ufe when erected: The building is amazingly strong, but at preSent I cannot, either in point of utility or beauty, fee it in any other light than that of forming an object in a landfcape, or terminating a view in a park, where the effect would be fine. When I have related to fome French the fashion in England, of building ruins as ornaments to rural fcenes, I have fcarce gained credit: It is true, they were perfons who had not been out of France ; but an imitation of what is beautiful, where an original is impossible, is an attempt fo natural, I am furprifed any one had not faith on that head. I am afraid you are more Vol. II.	C	than

Cicero obServes, could one be taken up to view all the beauties of the heavens, the enjoyment would be imperfect, without fome perfon to whom the ideas they raifed might be communicated; in this, as in most other quota-1 iions, I depend upon my memory, and fear I do not give the exact sense of the author: What is not Cicero’s, please to accept as mine. I am sensible of the inequallty of this recommendation in general, but am vain enough to hope it may fucceed with you. I have received more amusement from Nifmes, than any town since I left Paris.

LETTER XXIX.
I HE city of Nifmes is ill built,1 the streets very narrow, as in most old towns. The inhabitants are very numerous, thirty thoufand Protestants,’ C 2	and
[ 20 ]
and the Same number oS Catholics. The people are much at their eaSe. From a comparison of this place to Avignon, may be Seen how much more advantageous the ReSormed religion is to mankind, than the Roman Catholic : a strong preSumption in Savor oS the for-mer. That God wills the happineSs of his creatures, is the most certain truth oS any that engages the pens oS divines, Says a celebrated French writer. In every point, but religion, and priestly government, which is an effect of the Roman Catholic, the county VenaiS-Sin has the advantage of the county about NiSmes, being more Sertile, and the taxes very moderate. The Protestants not only enrich themSelves, by their industry and application to trade, but eaSe the Catholics, in Some refpects; as they Support their own poor, and
prevent
[ 21 ]
prevent convents and priests being So numerous, as in other towns of the Same size : here is leSs Superstition than in most places in this nation. The constant Society and connection between the people of each religion^ makes the Catholics avoid many follies to be Seen esse where, and renders the Protestants very attentive to recommend their religion by their lives. The bishop is a man oS great piety and candor,. whose merit and holy liSe are acknowledged even by the adverSe party, whoSe prejudices riSe to a most extraordinary height, I must own, though they are my brethren. Judge by the following instance of their Sentiments in general. The people oS the houSe where I lodged, assured me, the wild Beast in the Ge-vaudan was a jeSuit. I know one of the Protestant divines, who was edu-C 3	rated
[ 22 ]
cated at Geneva; he is a reafonable, Sensible man ; and though they have endeavoured to give him the most rigid principles of CalviniSm, I Sound he had no objections to EpiScopacy. I heard him preach; his language was good, and his Subject adapted to the congregation ; had the one been sine, and the other elevated, the rocks amidst which he was placed, would have understood as well as the audience. The Proteftants have but Sew ministers ; in general, they have no other qualification than courage and a good life; both are absolutely requisite. The people who are sick and old, have divine Service in their houSes, locking the door, and Setting a watch. In the Or-leannois, I happened to be in the houSe with a lady when her grand-daughter was buried ; the privacy and stillneSs gave i	So
[ 23 I
fo much the appearance of a murder, I could not stay till the ceremony was finished. At Nisines they think their preSent state very Sree ; Sor though the Same laws which Sormerly persecuted them remain in Sorce, they are Seldom put in execution, except by the bigotry of Some inferior magistrate, of which I have known an instance, with regard to two gentlemen ; but they had immediate redrefs upon application to the court; this liberty and tranquillity the Protestants impute to the expulsion of the jefuits; the fupposed cause of that event, may render the King more favorable to them : Though his Majesty does not give himself the trou-' ble of examining every article of faith, no one can be better convinced of tills point, that religion, or, at least, the particular part of it which endangers his C 4	life,
.	[ 24 ]
life, must be bad. The Protestants have formerly rofe in defence of a liberty to which they thought they had , a right; but never were concerned in a confpiracy against the perfon of their Sovereign. I believe the King of France would almost change the nature of his power with the King of England, to enjoy the fafety of the latter, who, I am perfuaded, might pafs alone thro* his capital, without any danger to his royal perfon. It is certain, every princely virtue that can attend a King, or private, which may ornament the character of man, are his, and command a guard as numerous as his fubjects ; yet all merit is ineffectual, where a mistaken zeal is stronger than gratitude and reafon. Languedoc is a sine province, the people much stronger than in many provinces ; in the Orleannois,
Berry,
\
[ 25 ]
Berry, and Some others, from living % ill, and working hard in the vineyards,
I have Seen women oS eighteen' look like thoSe oS fifty in England. France certainly is not fo populous as the British nation ;.but an argument I have* heard to prove they want men particularly, is by no means decisive ; this is, the women working in the fields ; a circumstance which proceeds from the vast standing army, and the love of parade. The French employ men-servants in almost every office in the house, that they may occasionally be turned into footmen ; I once faw a lady with three behind her coach, who were all the servants she had; when at home they were valet de chambre, cook, and la-quais. This may appear, at first sight; a trivial circumstance, but is not fo in its effects. Indeed, every point is consequential,
I 26}
sequential, in which a change may contribute to the real well-being of any * human creature ; how much more So when it regards numbers, and in Some refpects, the nation in general. The men being taken' Srom the Services abovementioned, Srom a labor where their strength is required, the poor women are deftroyed and rendered incapable of their domestic duties, by works they are not able to perform. I ashed a very Sensible Soreigner, who had visited England, What pleaSed him most in that nation ? he Said, the verdure of the fields, with the good looks and happy situation oS the peaSants. This is intended, Madam, as an excuSe for the liberty I So often take of mentioning your inferiors. I am this moment returned Srom Orange, where I •have been to See a triumphal arch, built
by
[ 27 ]
by Caius Marius, after his victory over the Cimbrians. I am told I shall Sec finer at Rome, to me this appears a most noble and Surprising edifice ; and being the first object of the kind, has had a striking effect: others, though more excellent, cannot have, as they
will be repetitions.---Company waits
for me to Set out Sor Aix ; from thence I shall again have the pleaSure of writing. I am,

SlNCE I arrived at Aix, I have had a visit from a perSon who is oS a province very remote from this. I dined
at
[ 28 ]
J
'at his houSe a Sew days after he had received letters of nobleffe ; his father was in the 'lowest rank of life. You can conceive nothing fo ridiculous as a Frenchman when he first finds himself a Gentleman. Monf. de—■— took particular pains, every moment, to call a poor farm-house his chateau, and a set of laboring servants, who waited on us without shoes or stockings, his gens. The lady’s behaviourwas correfpondent. They had an only fon, about ten years of age, and seven in size ; who, from too great an application to embroidery, and confectionary, looked as pale as ashes, and thin as a Skeleton. The poor boy had worked particularly hard that day; the father ashed, if he did not think the table well arranged, asiii-ring us it was entirely his Ton’s performance ; and tho’ fo young, as we faw,
he
[ 29 ]
he had kept his own linen in repair Several years. MonS. de----------, who is
really a Sond parent, added at the Same time he. should not, like many fathers, regard expence in his sen’s education ; on the contrary, as foon as his requisite domestic qualifications were perfected, he should learn those that were fupersi-cial, and ornamental; as the languages, history, philofophy, arms, &c. and then visit all the courts in Europe, particularly the British ; which this gentleman (if a man can fo Soon be made one) honors in a particular degree, as he imagines perfons of his birth are upon a better footing there than in France. Aix is a very handfome town; and being defended from the winds by the mountains, makes a very agreeable winter residence. Here is a parliament, and much good company. The Duke
de
[ 30 ]
de Villars has a very great house, when in this place : But no agrement can prevent me Setting out for MarSeilles to-morrow. Provence is a sine country, and particularly pleasing to an English eye, from the novelty of the Scene ; the mountainous aSpect, and the produce So different from ours, has infinite charms. The Sruits are the finest in France, particularly the grapes, figs and oranges ; the latter, ingrafted on pomegranates, are what Voltaire Says must have been the forbidden Sruit; none is in that state here, the reverSe, with the vegetables, which are very fine ; it makes a great part of the food of the country. The climate being hot, little meat is uSed, and yet the people are strong ; they are the handSomest in France. The water is exceeding good, whic^ I imagine is one
oS
[ 3i']
of the points which renders the South particularly Salutary ; in many parts of this kingdom it is bad. Wine is very cheap, but being drank new (a general defect in France) it is fo strong and heavy, as to be very difagreeable to a stranger; but the natives give it to their children with bread, as a foup. In proportion as nature is kind, art is neglected ;' if a severe winter happens, they are more distrest than we in our bad climate; I mean bad only in point of gardening; for I think Charles the second’s observation is just, thatteli-mate is best which will permit people to be most days in the year, and hours in the day, in the open air; and this advantage has England. The great heats in fummer, the terrible vent de biSe in the winter, render the air very difagreeable in the Southern parts of
France,
[ J2 ]	:
France, and leave only the latter part oS autumn, and beginning oS winter, perfectly agreeable to a stranger. The natives here, as in other provinces, make very little uSe of their houSes when it is poffible to live out oS them.
I paid a visit to a lady in Languedoc, r who, with her daughters, propos’d a walk, and led me into a Sorest, where Some people were hunting the wild boar.
We Sollowed the hounds for Some hours. The Languedocienne women are particularly lively and agile; in i other provinces, where they are not So able to walk, they sit in their gardens, upon the cours, in the streets, roads, and every where, except their own apartments. In this point we should do well to imitate them, with a reServe | to the roads and streets, which I think an aukward, idle situation Sor a man,

and very unbecoming a woman. I once Saw a lady full drest, Surrounded with men talking and laughing, Seated upon a bench in the road between Paris and Versailles : I imagined she was an opera girl, but Sound, on the contrary, her rank was as much above, as the others would have been beneath ridicule. To this manner oS living in the open air, amongst other cauSes, may be attributed the general chearSulneSs oS this nation. It is certain an Englishman, with all his advantages, is Sometimes ready to hang himSclf, and pities a Frenchman, whoSe great Spirits incline him to jump over his head. The French poS-iefs the art of making themSelves more generally happy than the English ; but I should imagine, when the latter is happy, his bliSs must be greater, as it~ ariSes Srom Sentiment and reflection, the -Vol. II.	D	others
[ 3+ ]
other’s Srom constitution, and inattention ; to the latter all the French cuS-toms contribute. I was much furprifed visiting a lady upon die. death of her Son, to find her in- all the colours of the rainbow.. I expressed my astonishment when I returned home, to a gentleman^ who expressed as much on hearing the Englifli fashion,, faying. Parents should never mourn for their children ; for it was great impropriety to wear that habit for an inferior. This idea of fupe-tiority,. which is just in fome refpectsr is too strongly afferted in France, by parents in general ; I am perfuaded their influence would be more lasting if it was acquired by a constant and early attention to the happiness of their children : As it is, the influence ceases with the' neceffity of compliance. A great French author obserres, grati-:	• .	*	tude;
[ 35 ]
tude is the principal law oS the English ; for what goes under the denomination of law, is not strong enough to bind the people to their King, children to their parents, wives to their huS-bands, &c. Sure this is the greatest praiSe that ever was given to people, and, as it comes Srom a stranger, we may hope it is, in Some degree, just. Indeed I think, in most oS thofe points (perhaps all, if rightly understood) the BritiSn perform their duties, at least, as well as the French, notwithstanding tile Severity of their laws are Such ; iS they N alone could bring virtue, and general order, this nation would See them flourish in the highest perfection. Added to the laws which regard the public, parents can confine worthleSs children, hushands wives, who merit that treatment,&c. The ladies, indeed, have taken D %	care
[ 36 ]
care to SoSten the laws, with relpect to them, et elles ont pris bien le change; for at preSent there are more men who require the protection of their ' wives, than women who claim it Srom that connection. The married oS your Sex, Madam, are Sovereigns in France, and most abSolute : The hissbands are treated like the parliament; the privilege, or at least the effect, of remonstrating is lost. IS you will permit me to Speak with freedom my Sentiments on this head, the ladies, in general, Succeed So ill in their government, both public and private, I am perSuaded every Sensible English woman, who has that disposition, would lose it upon a knowledge of their fuccefs. I think the -Englishmen have more refpect and tendernefs for the sex, generally fpeak-ing, than the French ; but they do not
obey
[ 37 ]
Obey their wives, nor attend their mistreffes So well : As to the latter, they may be excuSed Srom their attendance on public busineSs, wshich does not belong to men in France ; as to the Sormer, I have nothing to Say Sor my countrymen ; therefore shall leave them to plead their own cauSe, and content mySelS with alluring, I am, with the greatest attention, now and ever, Madam,

Nothing can be more pleasing than the approach to MarSeilles : The town, the Sea, the mountains, and D 3	rocks,
'L 38]
tocks, with the Bastidas d’alentour, form a Scene equally beautiful and variegated. The new part oS this city is handfome, particularly the cours, and street which leads to the Porte de Rome. The prodigious trade, and being a Sea port, brings a great concourSe of strangers. I have Seen Some singular habits; the most So was the wiSe oS an Indian merchant ; her veil reached almost to her feet, and her hair, which was braided with pearls and other orna-' ments, hung down her back to an amazing length. Through her veil, which was perfectly transparent, might be distinguished sine and regular Sea-tures ; her eyes shone like diamonds Set in yellow marble. Marfeilles is the only town, on this Side Paris, where Such figures could paSs peaceably. The French make great complaints against i	the
I 3 9 "]
the English mob ; their’s, though not So Spirited to affert the public liberty, is'' quite as much So to affert the particular liberty of being inSolent to strangers. A gentleman examining the bridge at Orleans, with great tranquillity, a mob came up and began to be very impertinent to him, meerly as a foreigner: he being an adroit Scholar of Broughton’s, laid Several of them upon the ground in a moment ; the rest fled, with the greatest precipitation, thinking his power more than human. The gentleman who gave this relation was much pleafed with the novelty of this •Surprizing manner oS fighting, as it appeared to him, and admired the perSon who So well executed this art, though against his countrymen ; whom juS-tice and politeneSs made him acknowledge were very culpable. Two ladies D 4	of
[ 40 ]
of my acquaintance travelling in English dresses, into the South, were, when descending Srom the chaiSe, Surrounded with a croud of people, who, examining their appearance very strictly, exclaimed qu’est-ce que c’est que cela ? qu’st-ce qui c’est que cela ? till one, who gave the tone to the whole group e, Said, Ah ce Sont des maures ? From this decision none appealed, though the ladies were neither of them brown ; and one amongst the Sairest of my countrywomen.------1 went to the play two
or three nights since ; it was le Depit amoreux. I interested mySelS greatly in the quarrel oS the two lovers, the only part of the piece which has any merit; but that I think extremely well expreS-Sed: it concludes like the charming ode oS Horace to Lydia, in a reconciliation equally pleasing and natural. I
have
[ 41 ]
have heard many people obServe, marriages contracted where there is only a common good liking, are happier .than thoSe founded upon Strong passions; they may appear in this light to a third perfon, who can judge but from the exterior, where a greater and more conStant tranquillity may reign : but thoSe who love to a certain degree, know there are pleaSures attending even a quarrel, Superior to any eaSe experienced by people who live together in that insipid Situation; which must be the conSe-quence of forming fuch a connection with only a common good liking. I am perfuaded the tranquillity and po-litenefs which may be Seen in France, between married people, proceeds more frequently from indifference than unity of sentiment.—As there was no play last night, I went to a petit fouper,
com-
[ 42 ]
composted of a dozen perSons, clergy, ladies, and officers ; the Sormer are always at enmity with the latter, at least, in appearance ; accordingly they rallied the priests with reSpect to the ladies, faying, they had much better marry, as -do the clergy in England, than attend the ladies as gallants : To which one of them replied; Un pretre peut avoir une foiblefse comme un autre homme, mais se marier, Sy done ; Sy done. A lady addressing me, with great furprife and Spirit, Said, Et vos eveques Se ma-rient 1 Sancta Maria que je voudrois bien voir la femme d’un cveque, quelle .drole de creature ! Many other things were Said, which equally shew the prejudices of education, if people have not reafon and SenSe to rife above them, and the danger of taking custom as a decisive judge of right and wrong. The
Sent!-
[ 43 ]
Sentiment oS the priest and lady, are far Srom being general to all Roman Catholics; there are many, and thoSe oS Such Superior understanding, they ought to balance ten times their number ; who think the celibacy oS the clergy as destructive oS private as of public good. A propos to the clergy are you acquainted with Bolleati’s Lutrin ? I thought it a good Satvr when I was in England ; but now being perfectly verSed in the characters, manners, and offices of the Set of people represented^ it appears most admirable, that stroke of the enraged priest purSuing his ad-, verfaries to bleSs them, from a Spirit of" vengeance, and they at the Same time* • hiding themSeives to eScape the blessing, as the highest infult, is most exquisite. The two concluding lines of this chapter are very good:

The Governor’s and Commandant houSes are almost the only reSort Sor perSons of Sashion. The town being principally compoSed of merchants and officers of the finances, who always make a considerable part oS every city; I mean considerable, with regard ta numbers: Where the noblesse are rich enough to deSpiSe and reSuSe their Society, they do ; but company must be had, and people who will play: For this reaSon the financiers are upon a good footing in Small towns ; for they never want money, however Scarce it may be in the nation. Some years since I have heard the parliaments propofed, if they might raise the taxes of the provinces 3	where
[ 46 ]
where they presided, to triple the Sum now paid into the King’s treaSury, and at the Same time eaSe the people considerably. The reaSons Sor rejecting this proposition are very apparent; it would have thrown much power into the hands of the parliament, which is ever avoided ; though, upon all occasions, they have demonstrated the strongest and most faithful attachment to their fovereign, which is very consistent, J with their regard to the public good.
It would likewiSe have deprived the court of many creatures, and rendered ' the anticipation of the public revenues
lefs eaSy.----A gentleman, who paid
me a visit the other day, Speaking of a perfon who was come to bathe in the Sea, related the following event : Being at Dunkirk, as he was walking Out of the town, he Saw, at a distance,
a vast
L 47 J
a vast number of people all on foot.. Amidst the croud he could distinguish ibme perlb ns of fuperior rank : When they drew near,, he afked the occasion of this procession,, and was informed the young man of quality who walked first,, had been bit by a mad dog; the consequences of which were fo violent they could not get hum into a carriage-,, ( though it was a considerable journey he had made to bathe in the Sea. Amidft the distortions and ravings of hie distemper, might be diseerned a most beautiful face, and sine figure. He was dress fed in black, with eighteen Sootmen in the lame habit ; Some of them held him with cords, fastened in Such a manner he had liberty to walk, yet not to hurt himSelS; the others followed weeping, with an old governor, almost as mad as: his pupil. But the situation of the father
t 4$ ]
ther and mother, who made up this urt-happy Suite, w&s beyond all description. They attempted to go with their Son to the ship, but the lady, from violent agitations oS hope and Sear, faint • ed, and was carried away as dead. The Sather persisted in feeing the operation performed Several times, Sor Several days, but without SucceSs. They were at length reduced to the cruel necessity (from the torments the young man Suffered) to call a conSultation Sor the most eaSy manner oS putting him to death : Bleeding was choSe, and accordingly executed. I do not believe you will thank me Sor this melancholy relation; but whatever strikes one, though painfully, it is natural to relate. I know not from what cauSe, but imagine it is the climate ; I never heard oS a perSon who recovered aSter this
misfor-
[ 49 ]
misfortune in France. The affair above-mentioned must have been teriib.e to the most indifferent parents ; unhappily, theSe were distinguished Sor affection to their unSortunate Son.—— As I do not love play, I Spend many evenings at the theatre; amongst other pieces, I have Seen Les Plaideurs ; the humor is very strong, but does not appear outree to thoSe who have lived long enough in this nation, to enter into the Spirit of the ridicule. The Normans are renowned for their love of chicanery ; but I think the fame disposition prevails all over France, at le<it, -■ wherever I have reSided. Many families are ruined by this litigious Spirit, and yet law is very cheap to what it is in England. I know a town where a gentleman, his wife, ar.d all the women of the place, were engaged
V9L, IL	E	is
[ 50 ]
in a law Suit; Several counSel were employed, and yet it did not cost above five guineas. The affair ended, as you may imagine, in favor oS the wife, and other women, who raiSed Such a party, the hushand could not walk in the streets without arms. Before the judges, in Small towns, and in trivial cauSes, people may plead for themSelves; the women, who are very attentive, on all occasions, to preServe their privileges, affert this. Some oS them diSplayed their eloquence in a town where I was upon a visit; I had not the amuSement of hearing them ; yet I am Satisfied they Succeeded as well as the attomies, who are Sometimes the pleaders in thefe courts. A Set of people, as ignorant in general, as dishonest. A common Soldier, and many things leSs honorable, astlime this profession. The French
are
i 51 ]
are obliged to apply to them in many of the Same affairs, which, in England, are decided by a justice of peace. This is a very great hardship, particularly upon the poor, whom they terribly op-preSs. It is likewiSe a reaSon why there are So many law Suits in this kingdom. The post is just going out, and will only permit me to Say, I am,

X HAVE made an excursion, Some leagues Srom this place, to be preSent at the wedding of a gentleman with whom I have formed an acquaintance during E 2	my,
1 52 ]
my reSidence in this place ; the entertainment was very elegant, and we had a bal maSque after Supper: this is an amuSement for which I thought their genius had been by no means calculated ; this being in a private houfe, was very well regulated ; but I was once present at a public bal maSque, where the wit was Solly, and the humor indecency : the great liberty of Speech which is permitted without a maSque, makes them know no bounds when they have that protection. What I Saw was in a provincial town ; I am told, the Parisian assemblies, of this kind, are much better, more brilliant, finer dresses, I conclude, but 1 should imagine the genius of the people is pretty much the fame every where. As to the ceremony of marriage, the only particular I have obServed is the brides, (if they
have
[ 53 ]
have never been married before) wear a little crown of silver, or gold ; btft I believe this is peculiar fo fome provinces. Oh, I forget, there is likewise another singularity ; fometimes the bridegroom has two or three boys kneeling on his side of the altar, and the bride as many girls on hers. I Suppose you know, wherever the canon law prevails, the children of two single people may, at any time, be legitimated by the marriage oS their parents ; it is difficult to Say whether this cuS-tom is desirable or not. It is very right a man should, iS he chuSes, legitimate s his own children; but by that act he may very oSten legitimate other peoples. A gentleman, in a province where I resided, had married in this style ; after his death, the mother took a dif-likc to one of her daughters, and, to E 3	prevent
[ 54 ]
prevent her sharing in Sortune with the ocher younger children, declared she w-s not the gentleman’s who had legitimated her, and propoSed to begin a law Suit to prove this shameful affer-tion. I know not whether fine proceeded, but heard Several perSons of . knowledge in the law Say, she would only expose herSelf if she did ; Sor the state of a child was too important a . point to depend upon the caprice oS a mother, particularly one who, whether she Said truth or Salshood in this particular, must be without truth or honor, in general. You See I am distrest Sor Subjects in this place, or I should not give what I do instead oS news. I have been Speaking oS a Singularity in one oS the church ceremonies; give me leave to tell you another : This is the ordaining an order of exorcists, with i •	the
[ 55 ]
the other orders of the priesthood. It is certain the common people in France are, as to their ideas oS devils, witches, &c. in pretty much the Same state they were in England, Some hundred years since; it cannot be otherwise, Sor though many of the clergy are too wiSe to exerciSe this power, they cannot own they do not believe it ; and Some, whoSe heads are not So good as their hearts, believe de bon coeur, and act in conlequence. I am acquainted with one who Spoke to the Devil in a cloud, to keep the storm from the vineyards : but the greatest effect I ever knew an exorcilin have, was with regard to a Scotch officer of my acquaintance, who lay deSperately ill of a wound he had received by the Springing a mine at a Siege in Germany : he had a Highland Servant, just come Srom Scotland, who, E 4	from
[ 56 ]
from his great attachment to his maf-ter, never went to bed ; when he could no longer watch, he wrapped himself up In his plaid, and siept in the corner of the room, which was very large. The people of the house recollecting the gentleman was a Catholic, sent a priest to him one morning, about two or three o’clock ; he entered the apartment, which had only a wax taper, and a few embers in the chimney,
Which taught light to counterfeit a gloom.
In this situation he proceeded to the bedside, without seeing the PLghlander, and began his exhortation to the gentleman, who being too ill to give much attention, the priest raised his voice fo high as to awaken the Highlander, who immediately starting up, between steeping and waking, seeing fomething in black,
con-
[ 57 ]
concluded it was the Devil, drew his Sword, and marched up to the priest, who had not more Savorabie Sentiments oS him, having a countenance full of Sury, and his hair standing upright with Sear; the Priest betook himSelS to the only arms he could uSe, waved his hand in the sign of a croSs, between him and his adverSary, repeating the terms oS exorciSm, in nomine pater, &c. but trusting still more to a retreat, made the best oShis way to the door; the Highlander Seeing his enemy sty, purSued to the top of the stairs, brandishing his Sword ; where the priest, Srom Sear (and having all the way walked backwards, the b tter to perSorm his office, and keep his adversary in view) Sell at once Srom the top to the bottom, with great noiSe, but little hurt; the gentleman, whom

'I PASSED the last evening very agreeably at a Supper. The French certainly do the honors of their house
very
[ 59 ]
very well, and have, whenever their fortunes will permit, holpitable and el.gant tables : But a circumstance one Sometimes Sees is very offensive to me, and I believe to all English ; this is the free manner oS their Servants. A valet de chambre, upon Several occasions, gave his opinions ; they were received, as well as uttered, in Such a manner, I am perSuaded he was always accustomed to this liberty, except in a rep as of ceremony. I 1 ave, in other provincial towns, Seen the Same behaviour at the tables oS perSons of quality. You think me very vain and singular, to dare ac-cuSe the French nation cS a deSect in politeneSs : but I Speak my own Sentiments when I addreSs you, not thofe of ' others; and the Sormer lead me to Say, in many points, the French are inSerior to the English, except the -court and
peiy
[ «o ]
perSons who Srequent it; there polite-neSs is in the highest perfection. I experienced more oS that quality the day I was at VerSailles, than I imagined strangers could find in any place without particular recommendation ; and I had none but what I have in common with every perfon who is his Britannic Majesty’s iubject, and a gentleman. As they were rallying me, last night, at the theatre, a gentleman told us of the passion his wiSe Sormerly had Sor that amuSement (mine, you know, is only in preSerence to play :) he married the lady from the convent, where she had been ever since the age oS Seven years: chance had went beyond the intentions oS the parents, having given the hushand and wiSe perSons and characters perfectly pleasing to each other ; though in the latter there i	was
[ 6i ]
was Something of a contrast, in Some reSpects. The lady placed a great degree oS happineSs in the hopes of living at the theatre: She declared, as Soon as she arrived at the gentleman’s houSe, she should go to the play that night, and every one of her liSe, at the fame time desired her hushand’s attendance ; which is not absolutely ridiculous in provincial towns, though not perfectly polite. Her humor continuing Sor Several months, the gentleman was rally’d by all his acquaintance, as added to the unSashionableneSs of attending a wiSe ; he was known to be ’ of a grave and studious disposition ; en-; tirely unaffected by the raillery, he an-Swered, I know the Sex wlll be attended ; as long as my wife gives me the preference, I will not resign my post to another. I fpend a few hours at an
amuse-
[ 62 ]
amufement, , w; ich has no charms for me, in hopes of pasting my life agreeably with a perSon who has So many. The gentleman’s patience was rewarded ; after about six months offering to attend his wife, as ufual, she protested she should never desire to See another play as long as she lived, and went immediately into the country ; where her temper was formed to his and true happinefs. You will be very glad to hear I intend to quit Marfeilles tomorrow, as I am clistrest for Sibjects to entertain ; the place having few objects which merit attention, I am obliged to go back, or give French converfations; and few of them give pleafure in the repetition, as I am perfuaded you find. They are very fond of wit; but, to do justice, they are easily contented on that head. I will conclude, after desiring
[ 63 ]
siring absolution for all past defects : I should be happy if you would imitate those priests who are fo provident as to give it for the future. I am particularly Sensible my language is very im-perfeest. An attention to the French has conSuSed my English. This is not affectation ; Sor I had rather you would imagine I know no other language than think I give any apreSerence ; as English has merit Superior to all modern of my acquaintance; and, what is more effential, it is the language of my country: but living much with the French, and having constant correspondence by letter, it is Scarce possible not to learn Some oS their idioms. It appears difficult to me to poffefs Several living languages at the Same time, ' in the least degree of perfection, or perhaps it may be only the two in question.

FrOM Marseilles to Leghorn I had the finest passage imaginable; the Sailors wished Sor more wind, but I was infinitely pleaSed with this new and noble Scene, and did not desire a change. The dolphins came and played about the lship sin great numbers, at a little distance the prodigious Spouting siSh, throwing up vast quantities oS water, with other marine wonders, preSented to my mind the great and Sublime description which Homer gives of Neptune and his attendants. The continuance oS this sine weather, gave me an opportunity oS observing the Setting fun, which has beautiSul effects upon this element ; and I was attentive not Vol. II.	F	to

to omit Seeing a greater and more strik-ing beauty the next morning, the daybreak, and the rising of the Same glorious luminary. Immediately after my debarkation at Leghorn, I Set out for Florence, which I shall quit tomorrow, as I propoSe to make a residence when I return. In this city Seeing many great and curious objects, in a short Space of time, the imagination is highly struck, and ideas raiSed So Sast, it is impoffible to give a just description ; Sor this reaSon,, and as the famous gallery has been often and mi-nutely deScribed, I shall only Speak of an object whose charms render silence impossible : this is the fo much, and defervedly celebrated Venus de Medi-cis. Whether one considers the exact, proportion, beauty, delicacy, or what is more amazing, the engaging modesty
[ 6-1 ]
desty of this figure, which Seems to wish to hide itSelf Srom the admiration it raifes ; the great powers and Superiority of the ancients, are equally attested.----Italy is a sine country; but
I am So partial to my own, I am not SurpriSed at the Cameron, who being ashed, as he travelled through Parma and Placentia, What he would do if master of that dutchy ? replied, Sell it, and buy an estate in Lochabar; which,
I have heard, is one oS the most barren parts oS the Highlands. I am threatened with the inconveniencies attending travellers in Italy, but they are not worth repeating; one circumstance in the Police, which was mentioned in company the other night, which is very singular : If a murder is committed » upon the road, the houSe is razed to the ground. IS there is Such an ordinance F £	(which
[ 68]
(which I very much doubt) I think it very good; as Srom thence perSons may be attentive to the character oS thoSe who hire their houSes. What makes me particularly remark this circumstance, is a letter I received when at Marseilles ; by which I find, two men and their wives, who kept an inn at Briare, were committed to priSon ; the men to be broke upon the wheel, the women hanged. One of the men was immediately concerned in an assassination at Paris ; they were both public pickpockets at Paris, and took this inn, which I believe is Sorty or siSty leagues distant, Sor a retreat. I was • there two days with Some company, one of our chaiSe breaking; the women Said their hushands were at the capital upon busineSs : one was more melancholy than I fver Saw a Frenchwoman ;
169 ]
woman ; and, by the account she gave of herSelS, will probably rather be hanged Sor her Solly, in marrying a man she did not know, than any real guilt. The laws in France are extremely rigid, even to the most distant accomplices. IS theSe women only knew of their huS-bands thefts, Sure they are not culpable Sor not declaring them ; at least, they might merit pity, if of the murderer I have no compassion. I think it is a deSect in France, that the punishment is almost equal; it certainly renders murders more common.—The expedition with which I make my journey, will not permit me to write again till it is finished ; but believe me ever

LETTER XXXVI.
I T is Some days since I arrived at Rome, once the capital of the world, oS which at preSent may be Seen the most magnificent remains. I will Speak of objects as they are esteemed most curious, or as they have appeared most striking to me ; both thoSe points unite with regard to the Pantheon; but I have not words Sufficiently expreS-sive Sor the noble architecture oS this great monument given us by antiquity. The entrance is by a most magnificent portico, Supported by pillars of oriental granite, of an amazing height and size. When, with difficulty and regret this work is quitted, to view the interior of
the
[ 7i ]
the rotunda, the mind is immediately silled with theSe ideas, which every Sacred building ought to raise ; but, in that point, none ever Succeeded So per-Sectly as this. Such a Surprising grand effect must arise from the Sublimity of the design alone ; the dimensions of this building being inconsiderable, compared with many others. For what is to be faid of the advantages of the figure, and the manner of this temple’s receiving light, I refer you to Mr. AddiSon’s judicious observations., in his Spectators, on the fublime, which I immediately recollected, though it is many years since I read them. Do not imagine this reference is to fave mySelf the trouble, you know it is otherw/fe ; but I can only repeat his words, or fay fomething leSs just : “ The ornaments “ of this building are, fome of them, F 4	Is sine
172 j
“ fine ; yet being mixed with many “ which have no merit, except that de- ' “ rived Srom Roman Catholic fuper-“ stition, the latter disfigure as much 46 as the former embellish.” I was extremely SurpriSed, Seeing a Virgin Mary by St. Luke, to find it So very indifferent a performance; for I did imagine they would have given him Some piece, which might have made us regret Such an author ; as it is, though I highly honor him as an evangelist, I am perfectly contented with a miferable Sinner Sor a painter. The Pantheon has lost most of its ancient ornaments. They truly deferved that name; many fine statues have been taken away, and the bronze, with which the roof was covered, now makes the magnificence oS the grand altar oS St. Peter’s : Tly.t the Spoils of the
Heathen
[ 73 ]
Heathen should adorn the temples of the true God, is very just ; but as this sine edifice jhas been consecrated as a church, I am highly difpleased it has been robbed to embellish any other, (much more that it has been injured for private uses) as none can ever equal it; at preSent the whole glory oS the structure must be given to the architect.—I shall next obServe the church of St. Peter : The court is the most noble I ever beheld, a vast collonnade conducts under cover to the church ; the pillars Support an architrave, ornamented with numerous statues of Saints and martyrs : In the midst of the court is a beauti-Sul obelifk, and on each fide a fine fountain. The outward appearance of St. Peter’s is, by no means, adequate to •tnis magnificent approach, being much inferior to St'. Paul’s in beauty, tho*
greatly
t 74 ]
greatly Superior in size. The grand facciata is in a style which would be very handfome Sor a palace, but destroys the uniformity oS the building as a church, and in that reSpect gives a great advantage to the English temple. The interior of this building is very magnificent, but did not strike me as I expected : it is agreed by all who see this edifice, the more Srequently it is viewed, and the greater the exactneSs , with which it is examined, So much higher is the admiration it raises : This I think an argument that the building receives more Srom the ornaments than from architecture ; the effect of beauty in the latter is immediate ; the former, where they are very numerous, must be considered before their merit is known. I believe many perfons confound the different effects together; as ,	I do
[ 75 ]
I do not, though the excellency oS the ornaments is great, I think there are too many, and too great a variety : a noble Simplicity, or ‘unity of ornaments, appears requisite in a Sacred building. The number of chapels which call the view from its principal point, are to me a defect ; though each oS them has beauties might alone make the merit oS an inSerior edifice. The grand altar oS Bronze, Supported by pillars of the Same metal, of a greater height and size than can be imagined (till the dimensions are taken) is a chef d’ceuvre in all reSpects; as is the chair of St. Peter, at the upper end of the church, Supported by the colloffiai sigures of the Sour great doctors ; a glory riSes to the roof of the building, the whole of gilt bronze. Beneath the chair is an altar, on each fide oS it is
a monu-
[ 76 ]
a monument of bronze and marble ; the two statues which adorn the tomb of Urban the eighth, are of great beauty. To Speak oS all that deServes atten-tention in this edifice, would be impossible in the compaSs oS a letter ; therefore, with regard to the vast dimensions, and a detail of the embellishments, I must refer you to the books wrote Sor that purpoSe. The invention of Mo-faic is of infinite merit, as it will prevent the great number oS sine pictures, in this church, having the Same fate others have Suffered by the humidity of the air in the buildings where they are placed. It is an odd exertion of power, and whimsical exerciSe of his office, the Pope perSorms in baptizing or conSe-crating Heathen images: As for in-stance the Jupiter Srom the Pantheon, which is now converted into St. Peter,
placed
t 77 I
placed in this church, and So highly re-verenced, his Seet are almost wore with the pious kisses they receive ; oS many I was a witneSs. The Same happy change has attended the figure now called St. Sebastian, in the church of St. Agnes. If the Pope has this power,, his charity should have extended to all the Heathens in the Rotunda, and have left them there. It is true, as every perSon’s Ideas have not a Catholic obedience, nor the Pope’s power is So expressive as the ancient statuaries, their works might have affected the mind according to the intentions oS the artists ; which would have rendered Some of them, perhaps, improper Sor a church, in our opinions, who go to - visst theSe Sacred buildings; but those who go there to worship, might, by Pontisicial faith, as well See a Magda-
'	lem
[ 78 ]
.'sen in Venus, as St. Peter in Jupiter. I met with one object difpleaSed me more than the above-mentioned great convert; this is a gilt lamb, that makes a most conSpicuous figure in a little chapel, on the leSt as you go up the church. The ear may hear figures oS Speech ; the representation of which, is too groSs Sor the eye to Support. Indeed, there is Such an impropriety, as well as fo much Solly, in the ornamental part of Roman Catholic churches in general, I preSer the plain state of ours, and would rather give up thoSe paintings and statues, which are just decorations, than Suffer the mixture. I have heard a perSon, who was undetermined (at least in appearance) with regard to religion, was adviSed, by the Protestant party, to take a journey to Rome, as a certain means oS fixing him
in
3
[ 79 ]	'
in their principles, to the great Surprise of his counsellors, he returned a pro-Sest Catholic, declaring that religion must be particularly Supported by God, which could stand where man did So much, in all reSpects, to destroy it. This is a French story, in which I can make no other observation, than the perSon’s party being(taken beSore the journey, or he never could have made this decision; the contrary would, in my opinion, have been a more natural effect; and I fancy in this judgment I am not singular.

To diversiSy the Subject of my letters, I -shall take leave of the buildings, till I have Spoke of Some living . objects, from whom I have received much amufement and instruction ; whoSe merit is acknowledged by all who have the pleaSure of their acquaintance ; indeed, Same and their works have carried their names where their perSons never appeared: TheSe are Sather LaSure and Jacquier, monks of the order of Mimims della T rinita de Monti, professors of mathematics to the Pope; how great their merit must be in that Science, being French, and having this preferment at Rome, is Sufficient demonstration : I can add, Srom 3	my
[ 8i ]
my ov/n knowledge, their geniuSes are not confined to one study, and what is more extraordinary, they poffeSs all the Sfavoir-vivre oS their country, in the best and most unlimited acceptation, ever entertaining, with unaffected modesty and humility, qualities as Seldom to be Sound in their profession as great and uSeSul learning, and quite as requisite for the Society into which their talents have given them a distinguished introduction, and where they return the honor ; for I think a perSon of Superior genius, who condeScends to affo-ciate with his inSeriors, in this relpect, conSers as great a Savor as when the condescension is in point of rank. It is certain, no Superiority is leSs pardoned, than that Sometimes affumed by perSons oS distinguished understandings, and pride never So easily Sup-Vol! II.	Q	ported
[ 82 ]
ported as when arising from high birth; this appears to me very unreasonable, and Unjust, as the former, though not entirely, is yet more a man’s own merit than the latter. I SuppoSe the rea-Sons for this manner oS acting are: every one is a Judge of great rank, and few of Superior understanding; and the advantages which may be derived Srom a connection with the former, are more defired than any the latter can give. Panion this digression, into which I have been led by the merit of theSe fathers ; but I do not intend it as an apology for them, as I never Saw the most common capacity attended with more eaSe and Simplicity. TheSe excellent perfons are united by friendship, sim-pathy of taste, and merit, in which I believe them equal, though it is only father LaSure I See -frequently. From
church •
[ J
churchmen to churches is a very natural transition ; thereSore I now paSs to St. John de Lateran, which pleaSes me as to the body of the building (I mean to Say the Nef) as well as St. Peter’s. The statues oS the apostles are a very great and just ornament; that of St. Matthew is absolutely Speaking. After this church, is generally ranked Santa Maria Maggiore; if it was to be admired as a sine gallery where a most beautiful altar is erected, magnificent chapels, and innumerable exquisite decorations, I should grant the admiration is just; but, as a temple, it must be placed in an inferior claSs, and Santa c “Maria degli Angioli have the preference; this is the Carthusians church. The figure, is a Grecian crofs, which J think mere eligible than any, except She .Rotunda, for a Sacred edifice. It G 2	sills
t
[ 84 ]
sills the eye better than the common form oS churches ; this is not vast, yet it strikes as Such ; and St. Agnes, in Piazza Navonna, though extremely Small, Srom the advantages oS the Same figure, does not appear So, at least not xliSagreeably little, as Santa Maria della Ysttoria, and churches in general of that Size, when built in the ordinary form. In the temple of which I am Speaking at preSent, are the monuments of thoSe eminent painters, Carlo Ma-ratti, and Salvator RoSa; the first was * defigned by himSelf, and his brother formed the bust; the only honor, I think, one could reSuSe, to the memory oS So near a relation. Here is a bap-tiSm of our Saviour, and many pieces oS merit; but I cannot Say they are in general paintings, that either strike or pleaSe me. St. Peter and Simon Magus
[ »5 ]

Lhave been, since I wrote my letter, to See two pictures of Salvator RoSa; they are landfchapes extremely sine. It is difficult to do justice to any kind of paintings by a defcription, but particularly these ; therefore I will not. make an attempt. An imaginary land-Schape, in a poem of Lord Littleton’s, I think is the prettiest I ever faw in writing. After seeing the pictures, I paid a visit to a convent; there was a young girl, just come to town to take the veil, the handfomest perfon I have Seen in Italy. It is unnecessary to ob-ferve, the women in these religious houses, are, in general, more beautiful than in France, as the Romans are a finer people ; but there are other rea* Tons why the nuns in Italy should fur-paSs the French in this refpect ; the custom of taking the veil is more com-G 4	mon,
[ 88 ] ' mon,' particularly amongst people of fashion ; and as with them necessity, not' religion, is the motive, they generally go into orders that are not severe ; on the contrary, see company, are at-v tended, many of them having servants ; which is not allowed in France, except to royal abbesses, and chanoinef-Ses. Most of the French nuns lead a laborious life. I have heard fome of the Italians have their Cavalieri Servienti, who visit at the grate, and make presents : oS the office oS theSe gentlemen attendants, when attached to the women oS the world, there is a comedy ©f Goldoni’s, which gives a just idea, as I have been inSormed by good judges, I do not pretend to be in the ' number. In Sienna this Service is in the highest perfection ; one woman has Sometimes six attendants : a lady oS my
ac-
L J
acquaintance Says, she has known many a man as tired of theSe mistresses as ever he knew any one of his wife ; but an ideal point oS honour, as it is a perSosss own creation, is stronger than that which exists independent oS his will, consequently an apparent attachment is continued to the former ; though very often a man will not give himself that trouble with regard to the latter. .1 find I shall make my postscript almost as long as my letter.

St. Jeronymo della Carita, not being universally known, you may be unacquainted with the merits oS this painting ; though, perhaps, upon the whole, they are equal to the piece I have mentioned. - This admirable pic-' tureis oSDomenichini: The dying Saint is receiving the communion (or rather the viaticum) according to the ceremonies of the Roman church ; his countenance is full of the greatest, and most just expression.

This sine piece being upon the wall, has already received much damage in the coloring, and will foon lose all its excellencies. In this church are other paintings of the fame author : they are, with many more works of great masters, proofs we should never decide upon the merit of a performance from the name of the artist; which is not very uncommon with I numbers who are, or at least-past for, virtuosifs.

paSs under that denomination without any just pretensions ; as many people have no other method of judging but by his name, and thoSe who have Superior knowledge, are aSraid to assert it, in contradiction to the Bon Ton, lest their own understanding, or modesty, should be called in question. The picture of Saint Romualdo, in a chapel oS the order of which he was Sounder, is added as a fourth piece by fome judges, but I do not think It has a right to be distinguished from many others, which ornament the churches and palaces in this city ; indeed, there is not Subject Sor a painting oS the first rank. The figure of the Saint and his attendant diSciples, are finely colored, and highly finished, and have as much expression as their Situation will admit but action, passion,
and
[ 94 ]
and Sentiment, are requisite, or rather all of them, to form a picture of the first merit : this piece is by Sacchi. You will think, Madam, my taste Sor painting has abforbed that oS music: not in the least ; but I cannot Say the latter has been fo perfectly Satisfied as the former : I have heard two or three concerts, which pleased me very well, and have been preSent at Some good church music. The Romans Say they have not So many good voices in Rome as they had Some years since: Those in the Pope’s chapel are most of them old, consequently not in their highest perfection ; yet, whatever difadvan-tages music has at present, compared to the advantages it may have had in this place, it is certainly very sine; a Surprizing ease and taste accompanying the Italians, unknown to any-other nation,

The natural indolence of the Italians, joined to that acquired by education, renders them, in general, unfit even Sor So pleaSmg an application.

You desire' Some information with regard to the Stuart family : my principles not leading me into the preSenee of the two remaining princes oS that race, I must Sometimes Speak from the authority oS others ; whenever I do, you will be a gainer, as I shall take the Sentiments oS thoSe who have judgment infinitely Superior to mine. I have Seen the Prince, en paffant, and the Cardinal perSorm maSs : I do not think either oS their perSons Singular enough to merit a particular description. I have heard they are very desirous oS looking like Englishmen ; they have, in my opinion, more of that appearance than could be imagined Srom the many fo-Vol. II	H	reign

reign circumstances which attend them. The Prince never had much capacity, though in the year Sorty-sive he certainly shewed great Spirit; since that time, the latter has Sunk to an. equality with the former, perhaps, in Some degree, from not having had occafions to exert it. When he had lived at his uncle’s, the Duke de Bouillon’s, he led the life of pleaSure and indolence, natural to disappointed and extinguished hopes. Pie then appeared So little of a bigot, the King oS France Said to the Duke de Bouillon, J intends que votre neveu va Se Saire Protestant. To which the Duke replied; Pourquoi non ; votre Majefte croit elle qti’il y’a un rovaume de dif-Serrence ?

Sir, you are not born to be a King; your life would be unhappy Srom the value you would Set upon that oS your Subjects. A very Sensible, and I should think, disinterested man, of the court of France, Said this was So Sar Srom true, during the time abovementioned, he was Seen at the opera, and every other place of amuSement, with the utmost gaiety; even to Such a degree, his child remarked (hearing a conversation upon the Subject) What heart must that man have, who could enjoy liSe when others were losing it from their attachment to him ! As this gentleman is a Sond father, I can SuppoSe him capable of improving his Son’s Speech, or giving him his own ; but, as a man of honor, I should think it impossible v he could invent the occasion ; though H 2 '	there
[ 10O ]
there are many French who are not Such well-wishers to the Stuart Samily as might be imagined Srom the agreement of their religious Sentiments. I heard one perSon Say, very justly, Did we not reSuSe the throne to the great Henry Quart, meerly Srom the difference oS religion ? How much stonger then is reaSon on the side where every cauSe combines * It is well known the Prince did not 'find a Savorable reception at Rome after his father’s death, which obliges him to a liSe of great Solitude; as he will not See the Italians upon the only terms they are permitted to visit him, he has no Society but his own houshold, and that is veiy Small. The Cardinal is a man of great piety, and strict morals. As to understanding, you are acquainted how great an effort nature made in favor of the family
[ 101 ]
mily in the perSon of Charles the Second ; and he shewing no gratitude, but, on the contrary, abusing her valuable giSt, she immediately returned to her Sormer negligence. ThoSe who do not like the Cardinal, and Such there are (though, as a Cardinal, I can See only merit) Say he is a bigot; his friends, that he is strongly attached to his religion, in the preSent state of the Samily (in which it will ever remain) this is a point mighty indifferent to an Englishman; he will, probably Srom his influence over his brother, attach him to the Catholic religion, -if he is not already attached. The Cardinal has several benefices in Italy, he is Chancellor of Rome, Arch-priest of St. Peter’s, and Bishop of Frafcati : I believe fome of theSe are rather honourable than lucrative ; but the Priory of $t. Amand, Hj	in

m Flanders, which the Prince received from the King of France, is fifteen or sixteen thouiand a year sterling. The Cardinal has great merit in his fraternal affection, as it has rose in proportion to his brother’s distrefs, who is obliged to the revenues of a state, in which he highly difapproved an engagement. You will be Surprised to find me mention natural affection as a merit ; I grant you have reaSon, yet I can plead the highest authority; Sor Horace Speaks of this kind as a great virtue, as you will not thank me Sor the Latin, I will endeavour to render the SenSe in English, though very indifferently ;

LETTER XL.
Th E palaces of this city are very numerous, I shall only Speak of the principal. It is the Same with regard to the painting which ornament their apartments ; a detail would take volumes ; therefore shall particularize
thoSe.
[ 105 ]
thoSe alone that preSent themSelves to my memory So strongly they oblige me to a distinction. The Vatican, the Pope’s first palace, though not his place of residence, is a prodigious large irregular building, without any beauty as to the exterior ; but, when you enter this edifice, the grandeur of the apartments, and excellence of the paintings, raiSe the highest pleaSure and admiration. The greatest masters in Italy here make their efforts to diSplay the powers of their art; beyond them all, Raphael distinguishes his genius in the highest perfection, and his Superb battle-pieces are, in general, esteemed the most valuable oS his performances, if considered with regard to the vaStneSs of the work, grandeur of the design, and multiplicity of figures; he certainly, in thefe, not only Surpasses ail x	others,
. . [ 1°6 ]
others, but himSelS. Yet there are leffer pieces, more highly finished,which, I think, give greater pleaSure in the contemplation, though they have not that Surprising grand effect. The School of Athens might amuSe Sor months ; indeed, all Raphael’s works should be Studied as well as Seen ; their beauties Speaking to the Understanding yet more than they charm the sight. The sire is an exceeding good piece; the delivery oS St. Peter Srom priSon, and So many others, it is impoffible to proceed : my memory, upon a first view, can retain but a very Small part oS the excellent paintings which adorn this palace ; to them I propofe frequent visits : at present I will Speak of the library, in geneneral terms, as I have of thePictures. You are well acquainted the Vatican library is esteemed the finest
in
[ i°7 ]
in the world, w hether you consider the books, or the buildings, in which they are deposited : the merit oS the'latter I k can attest, as to the former, much time must be Spent to Sorm a judgment. I Should imagine the learning oS the Schools compoSe too great a part oS this library. I can make no other observation of this kind of literature, as far as I have heard it adopted by Some divines, except that it is not Sufficiently clear, to convince, be refuted, or understood, but excellent at confusing the ideas of the audience. This building is painted in compartments, with-Subjects , agreeable to the poffeffors, and the ufe Sor which it is designed ; the histories of Popes and Councils, with other events regarding the church. There are likewise a vast number of pictures of learned perSons, particularly churchmen.
3	The
[ 108 ]
The paintings have a very sine effect. Indeed it is impossible to conceive any thing more beautiful than theSe apartments, or more extraordinary than their amazing length, which is a perte de vue. I will now paSs through the palace to the Belvedere; yet must: stop to look at a Cleopatra, whoSe merit might long engage attention; but upon entering the court of statues, all other ideas are lost, by a view of the greatest wonders this art ever preSented to sight: The principal is the Apollo ; where beauty without effeminacy, lightneSs and elegance c-f figure, without weakneSs, grace, youth, in short, ail the perfections which can attend the human figure, are represented in the highest degree. The Laocoon has as great merit Srom terrible, and painful, as the Apollo from pleasing expression. Here
is
[ i°9 J
is a sine Antinous, and Several other statues of great beauty and excellence. The celebrated TorSo of Hercules, is, I [think, too much maimed Sor any perfon, who is not an Antiquarian by profession, to discover its perfection : there is, indeed, prodigious strength and proportion, as far as remains of the . figure; as Sor the qualities of the Soul, which Abbot Winkleman pretends to See and admire ; they might just -as easily be distinguished in the nails of a man’s singers as this trunk. In short, I must; conSeSs I am not Sar enough advanced in my love of antiquity, to have any taste Sor this piece, in which I can find no expression, the highest beauty and merit oS every human figure formed by God or man,. It is this Sentiment that renders the following lines of Lord Littleton the most comprehensive, tho’
the
[ no ]
the most conciie description it is poS-sible to give of beauty, as well as virtue :
Her Sorm each beauty of her mind exprest ; Her mind was virtue, by the Graces drest.

LETTER XLI.
You are furpriSed I .can be fo long . in Rome without mentioning the Pope more particularly. The preSent Pontiff, Rezzonico, has no qualities that command attention; though his Holi-
neSs,
[ III ]
neSs, and the Romans in general, de-Serve the esteem of all strangers, Sor the eaSy situation, and agreeable reception, they find in this city. I will give, in Sew words, the general character of the Pope; which is perfectly agreeable to what I have heard from thoSe who have the honour of a personal acquaintance with his HolineSs.—He is an honest man, and good priest, but very indifferent prince, not poffeffing, in any degree, the talents requisite Sor govern- . ment ; nor has he much taste Sor the arts and Sciences, who lost their great protector in Lambertini. In Speaking of a Pope, the nephews should be introduced, as they have generally a great share in forming the character of the reign. Thefe gentlemen are, in several points, a contrast to each other : the eldest, a pious man, would always *	do
[ H2 ]
do well if his understanding could direct the means; and, as it is, being an honest man would do Some good, if a mistaken devotion did not engage him to Spend the time at his breviary, when he should be giving audience, and acting Sor the public welSare. The younger brother is a man of parts, but not So well inclined. The city of Rome is very ill inhabited, both in quality and quantity. It is compoSed of princes, or nobility, clergy and beggars, fcarce any of that rank of people necessary to the flourishing state of a great city, merchants, artizans, &c. As here is no commerce, and fo few manufacturers, it is no' wonder the people are in Such a deplorable state. How destructive an eccleflaStical government is to the well-being of a country, has been too often demonstrated for me to 3	make
[ iJ3 ]
make any valuable additions; therefore I shall not dwell upon this Head: indeed, a comparison of the former state oS this city to the preSent, is alone Sufficient demonstration. I should think this government cannot Subsist long* the revenues decreasing which aroSe Srom Superstition, and no other methods taken to Supply that deficiency. Rome has Some reSource in the strangers, whom the antique and other curiosities attract, and which by law are Sorbid to paSs into other nations ; but thoSe who can make an advantageous diSpoSai of theSe effects, find means to evade the prohibition. The paintings of private perSons quit their country in great quantities, as England can testify : but there will, Sor many ages, remain in Rome Sufficient to engage all thoSe who have leifure, and taste, to visit this Vol. II.	I	city.
[ it 4 1
city. The ruins of ancient buildings, sine modem edifices, and paintings, &c. which belonging to the public, or communities, cannot be alienated ; the manners, agreeable to the nature oS the government, are, consequently, very contrary to the proSperity of the city. Indolence, and a passion, for luxury, and pleaSure, appear the preSent characteristics oS a people, whoSe natural Superiority of genius might lead to distinguished actions. I faid, in one of my letters, how much we were inferior to the French in love of parade ; we are yet more fo to the Italians. I know an instance of a gentleman in France, ' who, having twenty or thirty servants, one fon and four daughters, was obliged to leffen his family: he did, by forcing all the ladies to be nuns. I am perSuaded this is too common a cir-
cumStance.
[ "5 ]
cumstance to be remarked in Rome* Even thoSe who have neither birth, nor bread, attempt equipage and figure; which, I think, is not the eaSe in England : and in the general luxury of the states, sthere is this great difference ;
_ the English ariSes Srom riches, and encourages commerce; the French and Italian, in Some points, Srom poverty,1 and prevents industry : a vast number of domestics, retained by perSons of moderate fortune, proceeds from the distrefs of the people, and continues it, by giving a habit of idlenefs. The 1 great wages of servants, high prices of workmen, and dearnefs of provisions, are thought by fome evils : in England, ' they are by no means to be regarded in this light by those who prefer public prosperity to private con-veniency; on the contrary, they are Such I 2	Strong
\
[ n6 ]
Strong and clear indications that trade and manuSactures flourish, and riches increaSe, it is Surprising to find perSons So fond of looking on the dark side of the object, as to imagine any one of theSe circumstances can drive the Eng-fish, particularly the people, into foreign countries : What advantage is it to a man he can buy a pound oS meat for one penny, which he may, in Some parts of Italy (provisions being cheaper than in France) when he will have more difficulty to gain that one, than ten in ^England ? A Nation where Sortunes may be made, and property ascertained, will ever be well inhabited. As Sor a few English, who have Settled at the head oS manuSactures in France, they have greater advantages than could be .given -to numbers ; yet, high as are thoSe advantages, I am perSuaded they 3	would
f 117 ]
would not have been accepted, if those perSons could have enjoyed the privileges of British fubjects, to which they were born : I know this is true, with regard to fome, and must fuppose, to all, if they are not very short-sighted; no one who is not, will, for any present advantage to themselves, deprive their posterity of an English Birthright. If fome families, whofe fortunes are inconvenient, live in France to make them convenient, it is only for a time ; and if they fucceed, it is not fo much from the cheapness of the country, as being content to live in a lefs way than they chufe at home; were it otherwise, they would be noprooS that the common people could find their interest in living in France, as thefe desire not to gain, but Save ; and the difference of expence, in the two nations, is not in I 3	meer

A FTER having made So long an excurSion, I return to my antiquities. You commanded, in part, the Subject oS my lash I rest upon the merit oS obedience,
[ 119 1
dience, nor have any other to claim. I will> just mention Monte Cavallo, as it is the palace where the Pope constantly resides, the air being esteemed the finest in Rome. The buildings are nothing extraordinary : in the apartments are Some good paintings, but much inferior to thoSe in the Vatican, and many other palaces, particularly the Collonna, which is in the first rank. The gallery is tire sineft I ever Saw, much Surpassing the celebrated one at VerSailles. The apartment is of a vast length, and just proportion : at the upper-end are fome beautiful pillars, of antique yellow marble ; but what makes the principal ornament, and riches of this gallery, is the paintings, which, though very numerous, are, in general, of the highest merit. The ceiling is very sine, representing the '	I 4	victory
' [ 120 ]
victory of Lepanto, where Marcus An-tonius Collonna commanded. But the beauty of this painting is infinitely Surpassed by that of the pictures and statues, which decorate each side of this magnificent gallery; they are most exquisite. OS theSe, and the paintings in the other apartments, where is every variety of style, I will Speak when I have taken a review ; but they are So numerous, and beautiful, it is impossible to avoid an agreeable confusion at first sight. Of the Cameo’s Intaglio’s, &c. I fay nothing, except that I am extremely pleased with what 1 have Seen of this kind here, and in other palaces; though little objects, they demand a greater attention than I have yet been able to give them. IS I stay in Rome the time I propoSe, shall endeavour to Sorm a judgment which
may
[ Al ]
may deScrve your hearing. The Far-neSe palace is esteemed, in point of architecture, the finest in this city ; - Michael Angelo was the architect. The greatest part of the stones oS this edifice were taken Srom the Coiloffeum of VeSpasian. The entrance oS the palace is by a grand portico, Supported by pillars oS the Doric order, and leads to a court whoSe buildings are Supported by arches, with long corridors. The celebrated statues of Hercules and Flora, are in this court; and in another, is the most prodigious and magnificent groupe, which reprefents the fable of Dirce. It is Sirprising they do not( find fome place it may ornament, instead of being shut up as lumber: notwithstanding the great quantities of sine statues in Rome, this piece deserves a situation where it might be seen, and
the
[ 122 ]
the size alone would command attention. The grand stair-cafe and hall, are enriched by the Sculptor’s art, both ancient and modem ; amongst the latter is Alexander FarneSe, crowned by Victory, with Flanders, and the ES-caut at his feet. In the gallery, painted by Salviati Zuccaro, is represented ' Charles the fifth, and Francis the first, giving hands ; the memorable acts of Paul the third, and Luther, in conference with the Pope’s Nuncio. The finest painting in this palace is the gallery, by Hannibal Carracci; the Subject is, the triumph of Bacchus; the Cyclop is esteemed a chef d’oevre of that author ; it certainly has great merit, but not of the find which most pleafes me. If the fcheme proposed had taken place, of joining the little FarneSe to this palace by a bridge, it
would
[ 123 ]	'
would have been one oS the finest in Europe; and the interior.beauty would have been correspondent. The paintings in the Longara, being most exquisite, they are by Raphael; the Loves of Cupid and Pfyche the Subject ': No pencil but his could have executed Such a work, the beauty and variety of expression is incomparable. In the Feast of the Gods, the particular attributes of each divinity are fo finely marked, and with fuch strength, they fpeak at once tnemfelves, and die great hand which drew them. I could dwell upon the beauties of Venus and Pfyche; the inexpressible grace of the former, when she petitions the gods in favour of Cupid ; the motion of the goddefs, requiring the pen of Virgil, or the great modern English poet, to defcribe (mine can give no idea) the different .	charms
[ *24 ]
charms of PSyche, agreeable to her change of Situation; and how finely Raphael has realized the graces. But I find, though in Speaking oS this palace I have been Sar Srom entering into a detail ; yet I have been tedious, at least I fear you will think me So, and not permit a performance oS my promise, with regard to others. Tell me Sreely your Sentiments, I shall, at any time, quit the most pleasing Scenes Rome can exhibit, Sor the pleaSure of writing. I am,

The Barbarini palace is esteemed in the first rank ; it appears to me rather a large houSe, Something is wanting to constitute the idea of palace ; if derived Srom the building, if Srom the inhabitants, this has the Same preten-' sions as many others; each floor has a Suite oS nine or ten grand apartments ; in the first are Some sine Cartoons, by Pietro Cortona and Romanelli ; the riches of this family were So prodigious in pictures and statues, large as the houSe is, great quantities lay rolled in upper apartments ; and though the preSent princes have diSpoSed oS a vast number, a considerable treaSure yet remains, The piece which most struck

[ i27 J
ture of a cavalcade, by Tempesta,. pleafed me Srom the idea it gives of that ancient and magnificent shew; this was taken Srom an entertainment ' given in the Piazza Barbarini, upon a marriage of one of the Samily. In this place are the Small antique statues of the three Graces, two pictures by Leonard da Vinci ; whoSe value is greatly enhanced, Srom the Small number remaining of that author’s works. With regard to the celebrated Magdalen by Guido, I must beg leave to dissent Srom the general opinion. I have heard, a thoufand pounds were offered Sor this piece ; to particular taste no bounds can be Set, but it was certainly more than the value of this picture, according to the Sentiments oS most connoif-Seurs (though their estimation is high) and much, much more, if I may be per-3	mitted

teitted to Speak mine. Hamilton’s picture oS innocence fold, I believe, for about fifty pounds ; write Guido under that, and a modern name under this figure, and, I am perfuaded, the difference would not be So great. The Magdalen, by Guido, is represented in the wilderneSs, as plump and wrell-looking as she could have been in Herod’s court. I have read a Sermon where many of the highest authorities are brought to prove her Sace was in that taste, and as many to prove the contrary : the preacher determines at last with great Jufiice, her countenance changed according to her manner of liSe. This being a French Sermon, un- j happily Guido has not received the least advantage Srom Such an excellent per-Sormance. In the EorgheSe palace is a Small Magdalen, by Hannibal Carracci,
which,
[ 129 ]
which, in my opinion, has insinitely more merit: in this piece, penitence, and horror, of her crimes, are painted in the strongest colors"; nor does the author Sacrifice expression and,proprie-ty of character, to beauty; (as does Guido) One Sees she has been hand-Some, but haggard cheeks, and enlarged features, leave only the remains. Where Guido Urines, and where alone he is equal to the other great masters, i-s when beauty and grace are the Sole requiflte expression : Such is his Aurora, in the RoSpogliofl palace, to which I can give no encomiums that will, in any degree, do it justice : call to mind the most beautiful and luxuriant description, by the greatest poetical genius, of Aurora, and her attendant figures ; and here See it realized.

In Spite of the mal-arrangement, the pleaSure I receive is inexpressible ; and I can distinguish Domenichini’s Mufe, his St. Cecilia, with a countenance expressive of the harmony residing in her Soul. Many .other pieces of that author, Some by Raphael, though the last: has not a K 3	great

I will finish with the Corfini palace, that does not require So much time and attention; though here is variety, and Some good authors ; an Ecce Homo by Guercino, exquisitely sine ; a beautiful Madonna j by Guido. It is certain, the veneration Catholics have for Sacred images and paintings is not So. ridiculous (though equally biameable when carried to a high degree) in Italy as France ; wl;ere I made a great blunder, taking the celebrated Notre Dame de Clery, Sor i	St. Louis •,

St. Louis ; obferving, at the Same time, the figure was rather too old and ugly* for that monarch: I was allured my Sentiments would. have changed had I Seen the image in holiday robes. The French Ideas of beauty are by no means -in the Madonna style. In this palace is a Madonna ..della Sedia, in needlework, that I leave to the ladies, pre-fering the effects of the pencil as more beautiful, though the caufe is lefs extraordinary. Here is a portrait by Tin-toret, and many other pieces, : which would be highly esteemed were they not in Rome : but this city has fo great a number of the first merit, thoSe not in the first rank have no great effect.
I lee here, for the first time, Some very pleasing pictures by the Rofalba, who was the greatest: hand in her style of painting. It .is to be lamented more JK .4	of

Lady AnSon, if her high birth, and yet much greater talents and merit, hacl not given a Superior distinction, might have been celebrated for this Science. The picture of Herodias’s daughter, dreffecl as a dancer, with St. John the Baptist’s head, is, by Some perSons, much admired. When I Say it is by Guido, you will conclude the figure is beautiful; for that author will Sacrifice the greatest merit of his art, Sooner than distort a single feature in a sine face. As the barbarous act was not her own choice, he might have given ■compassion, which foftens and heightens beauty; but I fuppofe she judged

A O change the Subject in Some degree, I will Speak of the public beau-, ties which ornament this city ; amongst-thefe are the obelishs : A very sine one, with Egyptian hieroglyphics, is^placed
in
[ 13* ]
in the Piazza del Popolo, where k has a great effect, not only at the entrance of the gate, but as it forms a point of view to Several streets. It was made five hundred and twenty-two years before the birth of our Saviour, and brought from Heliopolis to Rome, in the reign of Augustus. In the Piazza Navonna, which is very handfome from the buildings and ornaments (not from the figure, Sor that has no merit) is an-other Egyptian Obelifk : It forms a point to the capital fountain, which is in a large baSon covered with white marble. In the middle of the baSon rifes a rock cut into Sour grottos; at each is a noble statue, representing one of the following great rivers : The ' Danube, with an oar in his hand ; the .Ganges, by the figure of a Moor ; the Nile, with his head covered ; and the
fourth
[ 139 ]
fourth is the Silver River, or River de la Plata. In this Piazza is another Sountain, distinguished Sor the great Snell of marble; but meer marble is too common to deServe a look in Italy, except from a reflection on the beautiful and Surprising shapes into which it may be wrought. This city lias, in most Piazzas, many streets, and even houfes and fountains ; I cannot guefs at the number, it is fo great: the idea of their ufe, and the refreshment they convey in fo hot a country, adds much to their beauty. Above them all, I must distinguish the fountain Di Trevi, which Surpasses every thing of the kind I ever Saw. The performance is modern, and a demonstration the fame Sublimity cf defign and execution, attends the prefent, as the ancient Romans, if they had as great advantages:
This
£ 14®]
This fountain being alone more Strikingly noble than all the water-works at VerSailles. Perhaps you will think me partial to Rome, and all I See in this city. I acknowledge I had rather reside here than in Paris : yet I can diS-cern where the latter has the advantage. Les places, from the regularity , of the figure and uniformity of their buildings, as well as size, have Such -a Superiority, it is almost an affront to name them with the Piazzas of Rome ; which are all contemptibly little, except the Piazza Navonna, and that is irregular in all refpects. The apart- 1 ments oS the French hotels are more - conveniently diSpoSed than the Italian. The public walks atParis are great beauties, and very agreeable,f the constant-theatrical entertainments; Some in high perfection, are yet greater pleaSures:
but
[ r4I ]
tut thefe appear to me inferior'merits however, they are all truth can give, FI ad we a preference for the Italians* it would not be Surprising: they highly distinguish the English ; indeed they have a fovereLn hatred for the French, whole vanity will not acknowledge this point. Frenchmen, who have never been out of their own province, declare* Que le Francois estaime partout; and thoSe whom experience has ' convinced to the contrary, Say, it is the. jealoufy cf the Italian hushands which makes them fear the agreeableneSs, and consequently hate a Frenchman ; but whoever has made any residence in Rome knows Roman jealoufy bids fair to be as great an antique, as any this city can produce ; and if the Italians really had this paffion to as high a degree as the' French chufe to imagine, the number
of
[ H2 ]
of that station who visit Italy, is not Sufficiently great to raise* a general hatred, which goes So Sar, if you name a French Saint, the common anSwer is, E gran Santo, e peccato che sia Ftancefe, lie is a great faint ; it is a pity he is a Frenchman. The reaSon of this aversion, which has deScended from father to Son, ever since the wars the French have had with the Italians, is the ravages committed by the Sormer ; the Italians Say they were too great to be Sorgot i'n a few generations. I have heard more than one French officer avow, their ' troops are too wantonly cruel, even for their own interest, destroying in one day what might Support them ten, all the commands of their officers (notwithstanding their strict discipline) having been often ineffectual to restrain the

I A M this moment returned from the Colonna Trajana, which is still entire ; a noble monument of antiquity, and the gratitude of the senate, and Roman people, to the excellent man whose name it bears. This pillar is now badly situated; yet one may conceive how great must have been the effect when it was placed in the midst of the Forum, built by the faid Emperor ; upon this Colonna is represented the Dacian war. It is obServed, from the figures of theSe basso relievos, which are finely executed, Raphael Vol. II.	JL	took

I could give the exact dimensions of this sine monument, but they would add very little to your idea of its beauty, which is very great. At the top of the pillar was a statue of Tra*-jam, with a Scepter and globe, where were his ashes. St. Peter now Supplies his place. I had wrote thus far when I was Savoured with your letter; in that you afk, amongst other questions* Whether murders are as common in Italy as has been represented ? in an-Swer to this I can only Say, none have happened in Rome within my knowledge ; which,, perhaps, is no more than a proof these accidents have not happened to perfons of consequence. News-papers, where those and many other private events are published, I.
be-
2
[ 147 1
believe, are peculiar to England. A French lady argued, We must have more murders in England than in any nation; for she could read English, and Saw them in the papers : she might, by parity of reaSon, have Said, more children were born there than in the Grand Signior’s dominions. To do justice to the Italians, as far as a few months residence in Rome will permit me, I can see nothing in the disposition of the people to render murder more frequent than in other nations; that they were fo in this city, and are yet in parts of Italy, must be owing.to a defect in the government, their great poverty, and the eaSe with which they efcaped punishment; those who could not pay Sums of money, taking refuge at privileged altars, a great abuse and dishonour to religion. The poverty of L 2	the
[ 14^ ]
the people remains; but the other eauSes lessen every day, and the effects will Soon be inSensible. It is certain, the light of the reformation extends to thoSe who do not embrace its doctrine. The Roman Catholics, as you may imagine, will not acknowledge this truth; on the contrary, they alledge, ProtestantiSm has, in Some, decree, destroyed religion, and that a general liberty of conscience would compleat the destruction. To strengthen this,, they talk of the piety oS former ages, and the decrease of religion in the preSent ; which cannnot be granted, unleSs, as I SuppoSe, the definition oS religion is very different. IS the Catholic ideas only reach the external pomp and practice 'of ceremonials, with a belief of all the church of Rome commands, they have reafon in this light; but if, as I believe,..
I
I 149 1
'sieve, all Protestants understand the 'Christian religion, morality making the most effential part, we have only to compare, with coolnefs and impartiality, past ages to the preSent, and we shall find the Superiority of the latter, tho’ not .So great as might be wished. The vices and faults oS the ancients are viewed at a distance, their effect cannot extend to us, while thoSe of cotemporaries are in the strongest point of light; and we may Sometimes See too much by them to judge with indifference.--------The Go-
vernor oS this city is an Ecclesiastic, as is natural in a priestly government; the principal offices are held by perSons in that proSeffion ; the commanders of the gallies alone ex.cepted. They are all men of high birth. I have heard a gentleman observe, those veffcls contain a heaven, and a hell ; but I should
L 3	shave -
[ 15° ]
Have no idea oS enjoying the former fb near the latter. Even the Pope’s guards have a prelate for their commander ; I vdid not remark them when I Saw his HolineSs; but I well remember his Soldiers at Avignon were a burlefque-. upon every thing that is military. The Police in this city is very exact, and extends to many points, the honesty or eaSy circumstances of the English tradestnen renders unnecessary. Notwithstanding the Etiquette is So high, Some years since, at a concert in Cardinal Prince Stuart’s palace, three or Sour Italians left the affembly on hearing one of the company was engaged in commerce, (a perSon preSent assured me, he who gav.e the offence was a man oS quality, Some oS the offended not gentlemen) yet they allow them-Selves, in the French term, to Saire va-
loir ;
[ IS I ]
loir ; which they do, to So high a degree, once this winter, by a monopoly of oil, Said to be made by Several per-Sons of the first rank, the poor were deprived of this neceffary. How Sar commerce and nobility may be inconsistent, in Some countries, I will not pretend to determine, nor have any interest in the decision ; but this is very clear, thoSe who deSpiSe the honest part oS businefs, and the commerce advantageous to the public, should not defcend to practiSe by themSelves, or agents, what is the reverfe. The vast number oS new families made every reign by the nature of this government, are very prejudicial to the public. The Popes give rank and titles, but their fupport must come directly or indirectly from the people ; the foreign refources, as I -shave observed upon another occasion, L 4	being
[ 152 ]
being very inconsiderable : as there is always a probability of a short reign, the expedition is the greater (and consequently the oppression) in acquiring -fortunes ; and if SucceSs is not equal to their efforts, pensions Srom charitable foundations, are often given to fup-port rank. Whether a man is called Duke, Prince, Count, or by his name, is a point of no effential consequence to the public ; but if they are to pay the title, it is a high injustice, unleSs he has merited it by his services to the nation ; and when that is the cafe, there will never be even a murmur, that claimants are too numerous. If one was to come immediately Srom England to Rome, the astonishment would be great, to find it is impossible to Speak to an Italian who has not a title ; but it is not So striking in France, where the 2	ladies
[ i53 1
ladies Sometimes create a Marquis, as they name a trump; this title being very common, and indeed Count is So in a great degree, MonS. de Nesie, who was a Marquis, and might pretend to any title from his great and ancient Samily had, in his brevet, when he went to compliment the Czar, Peter the Great; this distinction, Premier gentil-homme de France. I have heard Several oS the best Samilies in Rome never would accept titles. I will conclude this letter with an anecdote concerning Lambertini; which shews how very injurious he thought giving rank, except commanded by merit, was to this city. He had a nephew, a student at Rome ; he called Sor him, and Said, in the preSence of his tutor, Sir, depend not upon your relation to me ; you came a poor gentleman Srom Bologna,
and
t 154 ], -
sfid fuch you will return, if fuperior
merit does not command Superior rank. I believe you will think with me, the Pope’s public Spirit was too rigid. He was So exact to his word, the young man had no benefice at his uncle’s death, nor many years aSterwards. At length a perSon oS quality in Bologna (the nephew having nothing bad in his character) procured him Some considerable preferment, as a mark of gratitude to the Self-denial of Lambertini, I am,

JL HOUGH I have not yet examined the beauties oS all the palaces in the city, to change the Scene, I make little excursions to the villas of the nobility, which adds much to the agre-mens of this place. I will first Speak of the Villa de Medicis, as it is within the walls. The house, but for the basso relievos adorning the front towards the garden, would not deserve attention, they are sine ; the remarkable actions of the Romans are the Subjects. Near the houSe are Several valuable antique statues; and there are fome in an alcove on the right. What calls for the highest admiration, is a groupe of figures
repre-
[ 156 ]
representing Niobe and her children, by Praxiteles. The statue oS Niobe is esteemed one oS the finest ever made ; the proportion is certainly exquisite, and the beauty great ; but I have Seen pieces oS Sculpture, to me, more pleasing. The gardens are in the state of thoSe whoSe proprietors have either wanted taste or fortune to change their Sorm Sor theSe hundred years : their only advantage is the command oS a sine and extensive view of the city. I should except the ornaments, for added -to the statues, there is a Small but beau-tiSul obelilk ; I believe Rome has, at least, siSty of theSe ancient monuments. In the apartments of this villa is the little Apollo, and other statues of merit. When I return to England, all JhouSes will appear empty and incom-
pleat, which have not thefe ornaments
or
[ 157 ]
or paintings. Apropos to this Subject, you will Soon See the performances of Chriffon, a Frenchman, who not finding encouragement, here, proposes to. go to England. What I faw of the antiquities, I knew gave me reafon to-conclude, that those with w-homI was acquainted were represented with justice. I think he has merit, and am charmed to see the beauties of antiquity travel to-England in every form and style. The Villa Borghese, in Porta Pinciana, is a sinall distance from the city ; the entrance is by a handfome portone, over which is a basso relievo, representing a Roman facrisice. You have a sine long walk in view; but the verdure has a. pleasing effect, and the weather is warm-enough to enjoy that pleaSure, though the Seaton is So Sar advanced. The houSe is Small, and like the Villa de
Me-
[ 158 ]
Medicis, derives its beauty from the rich Sculpture with which it is decorated, and Surpasses the former, in this reSpect, having three Facciate ornamented : the principal has not only basso-relievos, but Several antique statues ; thoSe of Marcus Aurelius, and Marcus Antoninus ; the buits of Trajan and Adrian. The basso-relievos reprefent various Singular actions and events, related in the Roman history : The peace between the Romans and. Sabines ; Curtius leaping into the gulph Sor the preservation of his country : TheSe give great pleaSure in the view, but would not in a relation, at least, by my pen. In the apartments are Some good statues, both antique and modern ; Several baffo-relievos, one with Cupid and Venus, Suppofed to be by Praxiteles ; Bacchus upon a Sepul--	-	chre,
t *59 }
ehre, on which is engraved the death of Meleager ; a statue of Agrippina ; the heads of Livia, and Berenice; but I will not pretend to give a detail, as I fhall only sill my letters with names oS objects whoSe beauties I cannot describe, and even of the names my memory may not preSent thoSe most deserving attention. Bernini has many performances in thofe apartments : his David going to engage Goliah, is esteemed a piece oS great merit. When I first came to Rome, I was greatly charmed with a monument in the Madonna della Vittoria,. where an angel defcends to Saint TereSa, who is dying. This is the work oS Bernini. Now this, and every modern piece oS Sculpture, want that noble simplicity, with which the ancient are generally attended. Do not imagine this inclination for antiquity

BeSore they went Srom this city, the Pope gave them a diSpenSation as to habit, as well as Sood, theirs being inconvenient to a court-life, as when they were obliged to pay obedience to monastic rules. Rouffeau’s observation could not, I believe, be applied to them ; “ the human mind is too limited to embrace every object : the Monks attached and exact to perSorm the Minutiae oS religion, Sor-get the effential, to be an honest man.”

I SHOULD be happy to employ more time in obeying your commands than my preSent situation will permit. In Speaking of the amuSements in this city, I will begin with- the Lago, nor from excellency, but peculiarity. The Piazza Navonna,.. on this occasion, is laid under water about three Seet deep, in which the coaches drive with ladies drest as Sor a ball. Many more behold this diversion, exhibition, or whatever denomination you please to-give, from the ringheras,-' or, balconies.; where they are attended by Abbots, the Petits Maitres of this place. The women were very numerous, and .	of
[ i63 ]
of the first rank ; but I think there is more beauty in the lower claSs, and in this Sentiment I am not singular. I did not See above two or three girls of fashion; they-are, in general, shut up in Convents till a propofal of marriage is made ; if none is made before a certain age, they are there for life. The extraordinary amusement I have mentioned, is to be seen only the four Sundays in August, when the weather is excessively hot, and the city regarded as unwholefome ; yet a great many perSons of condition stay in town. I am inclined to think it is only in fome particular quarters of Rome that the air is bad; where the English lodge, in general, I believe is always falubrious ; the Trinita de Monti is remarkably fo; and I conclude, wherever the nobility inhabit, or they would be more dif-M 2	posed
[ r6+ ]
posed to a country liSe, Sor which they appear to have leSs inclination than-even the French; perhaps they have reaSon, aSter Speaking of the diversion in Piazza Navonna, you will think Rome is distrest on that head. Here are concerts perpetually, Some balls, and I believe, in the carnival, all Sorts of diversions, Srom the Opera to Punchinello ; excepting this SeaSon, I should-imagine time must hang heavy upon the hands oS the inhabitants, though it s is far otherwise with me : in general they have no taste Sor the curiosities of the place ; nor do they love study, or even books of amusement. French is lefs understood in this, than any polite city of Europe; very few women, though of the highest-rank, conversing or reading in that language; which is a lofs ; for notwithstanding
many
'[ 165 3
many nations have more writers oS the first merit; yet, Srom the French, may she collected a ufeSul and entertaining library ; they, in general, write with precision, and other excellencies advantageous to perSons whoSe inclinations, or capacities do not lead to Superior studies : the English leSs want, and .and are more ready to claim, the assistance oS their neighbours than any other nation. The Italians have not a great number, nor variety of authors, but they have Some most excellent; Dante, Tasso, and Ariosto. The French cannot pretend to a comparison in heroic poetry : We have Spencer Sor Ariosto j sand Milton Surpasses Taffo ; Dante I understand enough highly to admire, shut perhaps not,to do justice by .a de-cision. The pastoral poetry of,,the Italians I think excels all others, though ,M 3	J know
r 166 ]
I know it is not beyond criticiSm. In general, the writers of this nation are poets, to whom their language is very advantageous. I believe tne Italians are too idle to write, if genius or necessity does not command. Th French are the reverse ; many Scribble for pleasure, what none; except themSelves or particular friends, will ever read ; but, in the great numbers, Some Succeed; and this 'disposition gives an amazing variety of Subjects, as well as authors. I read your favorite Metastasio with greater pleaSure than ever ; though his stile is ealy, yet, Srom a farther knowledge oS the pronunciation, there is certainly a great deal in the harmony of the verse, which this author particularly studied, as he wrote for music. Haile was always inclined to compose ior Ins operas, with leSs pay than other
writers;
I i«7 ]
writers ; the strong SenSe leading to adequate Sounds. The Italians, I was going to fayp (when their poetry took me from my Subject) appear, rather diSpoSed to learn a language more advantageous than the French, in point of reading and knowledge, but where they would find more difficulty, I mean the English ; in my opinion the analogy of the British and Italian. character is greater than that oS either of thoSe na-tions and the French. It is remarkable, though the French very Soon Speak Italian, as: far as is necessary for uSe, yet. they never arrive at any great perfections : the languages appear to me ana- ■ logous as- to s the formation of the words, not fo in the idioms and accent;. this, I shouldt think, must be the rea-fon. How very low the Italian comic writers are at present, Goldoni is a M 4	proof;
[ i68 ]
proof; Sor he is read, and 1 have heard the representation was applauded. Indeed an author for the Theatre, tho* he may strengthen and heighten his characters, must, in comedy, draw Srom liSe. Moliere’s works were, and are yet, in a great degree, the characteristics of his nation ; much, and variety oS ridicule in the people in general, their share of vice, as Sar as it is in the Sphere of a comic writer to repreSent, and, at the Same time, Some characters, whoSe wit, knowledge, and virtue, do honor to thehuman race. There is apo-> verty of character amongst the preSent Romans (I have heard the Same with regard to the Italians in general) not from any defect in genius ; for they appear in this, as in former ages, to receive much from nature. You may See in the children, though lively, a
Sedate-
[ i69 ] '
Sedatenefs and reflection, which, if properly applied and cultivated, must produce great and good effects ; but unhappily Sor them, this sine, natural genius degenerates from a defect in education, and the contracted circle in which it is obliged to act. The understanding is principally exerted in caballing Sor private interests ; no wonder it should it be So, where the pretensions to the highest rank, and most Sacred office, are decided by no other means than a Superior cabal. Public Spirit shews its head in France, though it is obliged to caution; here it makes no attempt. Much time is given to gallantry, when not inconsistent with affairs ; and here, as in the French nation, they endeavour to unite them. Thefe dispositions are So strong, thoSe who have no particular perSon to en-i	gage*
[ i7° ]
gage, nor are concerned in church preferments, find the conversation very insipid. My opinion in this point could have no weight ; but it is the Sentiment of many, that have much Sre-quented them. A considerable perSon of a .northern court, who prelented himSelf at one of the first affemblies, in all reSpects declared he had the utmost difficulty to stay the time politeneSs -required, the conversation turning entirely upon promotions in the church,* -and other topics, in which it was irn-poffible Sor any but the parties immediately concerned to be interested. I have been in company With Some'Italians, who were esteemed wits ; but I think they owed that distinction to their Society, with whom they were compared; at least they must appear in that light to thofe who have had the
honor
[ 171 ]
honor of conversing with Mr. Grey, and other perSons oS Superior genius in England ; a happy and Sree government not only Secures the greater bleS-iings oS life, but gives birth to wit, humor, and every agreement of conversation. Perhaps I have made this observation already, and I am perSuaded thouSands have made it before me; but you must pardon the repetition of a Sentiment So natural; and to which * all I hear, and every object I See, contributes. I am afraid you will think me as tedious as the northern minister did the Italian converSazione. Take the advantage, throw my'setter aside, or burn it ; but let me sirst tell you I am, with the greatest esteem and reSpect,
„	Madam,

P. S.
[ 172 ]
P. S. Tho* you may feel ennuy at the Italian converSazioni, you will not have that opportunity at their tables; in this point the French much SurpaSs them ; added to thoSe who, Srom their places, have appointments Srom the court to entertain. Every gentleman Avho pretends to figure, has both an cdegant and hoSpitable houSe. I know one in particular, a Norman, in this reSpect he lives more like a prince than .any man at Rome, and has a wiSe to .do the honors of his table, who has .a .beauty as pleasing as the Italians, the virtues and accomplishments of every,
• without the defects of any nation.
I made no great uSe oS this Sociable manner oS living; yet I think hoSpi--tallity, at least, as requisite to a gentleman as equipage and attendance;
though

though I do- not carry it quite So far as the French, in thinking it neceffary to the state of a dead perfon. All those of the very highest rank, as long as they rest on earth, have a table served in ^ the apartment where their remains are deposited, an attendant approaches the corps, and fays; Monsieur, ou Madame, est servi.

The basso - relievos illustrate many events in ancient history, and their figurative expression attests the luxuriant and elevated genius ©f the authors. I could amuSe myself for weeks in reading
[176]
ing the emblematical writings upon Some of the antique Sepulchres. I have Seen this collection but once, the next time will take notes. It is a common observation, Great wits have short memories ; in Some reSpects I believe they may : having a genius fertile in raising ideas, renders them inattentive to thoSe exterior objects in general preSent, and of their own, the Succession is So quick, the impression cannot be strong. I am : going Srom what I have Said, to draw an excuSe for my want of memory ; though the cauSe is very different, mine proceeding from the great genius of others, theirs Srom their own ; but the effect is i the Same. The vast number and variety of objects at the Campidoglio, occasioned Such a quick Succession of ideas, they have leSt, though a very strong general impression, that of particulars
C U7 1
ticulars very weak: Sor this reafon 1 will leave them at preSent, not without gratitude to Lambeftini for tste amusement of the day, and the pleasing reflections which will frequently arife. The Romans, ever desirous of a new Pope, regard an election as fhe great holiday of the city. I am per-fuaded they lost; the excellent perfon above-mentioned without concern ; though they have much regret he is not now alive. As for the Pontiff, who at present sills the throne, he had a trifling cold, and the hopes of all Route were raised to the highest degree ; a conclave was the Subject of conversation, and the great number of strangers who would attend the event. I remember once hearing Some French observe their votes were of no consequence on this occafion; for the Italians Vol. II.	N	always
[ 178 ]
always outwitted, or rather conquered' them by SalSehood ; the latter is very extraordinary: where the honor of a " Frenchman is concerned, I would depend upon his veracity, but as that is not even SuppoSed to enter into political affairs, the Italians do wonders if they make a drawn battle. I can easily ‘ conceive they SurpaSs the French in Secrecy and silence, points very consequential in the busineSs of a conclave.
The French certainly have a great talent Sor diScerning fentiments by countenances : the Italians as great in concealing them. The vanity of the former lays them open to thoSe who desire to penetrate their Schemes; pride is more reServed. I have been assured, in a meeting of Cardinals, Some oS whom were Transalpine, the principal topic was the merits of French and Italian •	■ ■	pomatum
[ 179 ]'
pomatum. Though I know the Spirit •oS trifling’ is great in one nation (oS the other I am not So good a judge) yet I I must Suppofe a Sear of discovering their Sentiments on more consequential Subjects gave riSe to this. Whatever ■was the motive, the conversation was foolish enough, but a better employment much Sor their geniuSes, than when engaged in Sending sire and Sword all over lilurope, and making acts, almost • ,.as abStird, though not So innocent as Boileau’s Burlelque Arret, from Parnassus, in Savor oS the Aristotelian principles. Que lia. terre Se repoSe, que le So lei 1 tourne autourd’elle ; Sous peine .d’excommunicatkn, &c. if St. Dominick had been a Petit Maitre, lolling in • the most luxurious carriage, it would Jia.ye been happier Sor his cotempora-N 2	Ties,

ries, and many Succeeding ages, than his walking bareSooted Severities. The pleaSurable liSe of Some churchmen, however unbecoming the Sanctity of their profession, is yet more eligible, than the persecuting troublefome Spirit of forne of their turbulent faints. The inquisition is here (and I believe now . in every place) a meer form, and ! name ; I should not have known it existed,, but from hearing Prince Cor-sini. attended that assembly once or twice a week ; which: was the best time to fee his palace.. I do not think, present, there is a place on earth where strangers live with more liberty than, Rome, and die with the fame; this cannot be Said of France, where, for' reafons well known to themselves, they chuse to be troublefome to the dying,

and infult the dead rather than living.
I Speak of the people, or thoSe a few degrees above them ; for the King and Court have always decided with justice and humanity, when application has been made upon thefe occasions. I will conclude, after writing a bon mot of Lambertini not mill a propos to this Subject. A French nobleman afked, What he thought of the Bull IJnigeni-tus ? (concerning the Jansenists) the Pope replied; I think you are much to blame for making Such a noise about ’ that affair, when we only regard it as a natural daughter of our predecessors, whom honor obliges us to Support. It is not wonderful Lambertini should be

JL HE Villa Albani is a Snail diS* tance from the city. The building is not large enough for magnificence. Upon the sirS view it appears rather mean, being very low in proportion to the 'length. The ornaments are beautiful, fome antique, and the imitations happily executed. The portico is hand-fome, Supported by Egyptian pillars, . and in .niches are the statues of the Cae-Sars, upon pedestals enriched with baf-
fo-
a
[ 1.83 ].
Sb-relievos; the Domitian is the only one entire oS this prince ; that circumstance gives it no merit with me: I am better pleaSed with thofe I can regard as monuments of detestation for a tyrant. In the first apartments are fome fine veffels of alabaster, granite, &c. on the right is a chapel highly ornamented. In the galleiy (the only room of tolerable fize) there is a statue of Pallas; from which one may imagine the ancients, as well as moderns, neglected her for Venus. There is another of Ino, with Bacchus in her arms: the pillars of this apartment are. fome antique Mo-faic, the chapiters, and bases gilt, the deling is painted, and highly finished, by Mengs. Nothing can be more ornamented or dazzling than this palace in miniature. On defcending are two porticos; in one, the busts of the most N 4	cele-
[ 1*4 ]
celebrated captains ; in the other, of philofophers, poets, and rhetoricians. On the right is a grove, on the left a little ap rtment, whose roof is fupport-ed by two large pillars, one an entire piece of flowered alabaster. Here are several baffo-relievos, and many learned curiofities of antiquity: to this is joined a Small Ionic 'terhple, which makes a very beautiful peripective to the grand portico; the deity is an Fphe-sian Diana. On the other side of the house is a semicircular portico, embellished, or rather enriched, with many statues ; one of Theban alabaster, much larger than the Site : this, faith regard to the fubstance, is the finest, and most curious, I ever faw ; the figure of the deity represented, is equally horrid and ridiculous, as Egyptian divinities in general are : that nation could
not
[ i*5 ]
riot be accessed of idolizing beauty; had they been as free from every other kind of idolatry, they would better have deserved ‘their reputation of wiSdom. True religion is for all the world, not to be confined to a few misticks, or initiated. The gardens are neither large nor sine, except as they are ornamented with statues, fountains, and all the curiosities, and imitations of antiquity, agreeable to the place. The preSent Cardinal Albani, who is a great virtuosi), built and beautified this houSe and and villa, which was a vineyard. I think his eminence 'could never intend it as a habitation; in that light it is better adapted to pigmies than Romans ; if he only propofed to shew his taste, the SucceSs is anfwerable to his intention. I have been more particular than 2	uSual
[ i86 ]
uSual in my description, as I shall-not. revisit this villa ; a day is much here, as a month at the Colonna palace, Vatican, or Campidoglio; the sight was alone pleaSed this day ; the mind had not exerciSe enough to be even^content. From hence I will go to the modern, particularly portrait painters; in my way I will mention Mr. Hamilton, though that is not the first point oS view in which he'is to be considered ; his merit is principally in historical pieces. He has no great finished painting in his houSe at preSent; the death of Lucretia is, not Sar enough advanced Sor me to Sorm any judgment Srom the SucceSs he has hitherto had in pictures of that style, I should imagine this will be considerable. Battoni is generally esteemed the sirst Sor his portraits; the reSemblances
are
[ 1*7 ]
are strong and striking, I think they are very often caricaturas : I Saw Some of my acquaintance, to whom he had, by no means, done justice. He had one piece very sine; but there were circumstances attending, which gave a merit beyond a common portrait, and he had Succeeded in highly marking the requisite expression. Battoni has Several historical pictures much esteemed, in Rome, and Some, I conclude you have Seen in England. From Battoni I went to Maron, where I Sound my acquaintance better treated. As a meer portrait painter (and I do not know he attempts a higher merit) I think Maron deferves to be ranked in the first claSs ; the resemblances he takes are both strong and pleasing, yet not flattering. Indeed I do not See why a Frenchman
may
L i8» 1
may not equal an Italian in this branch: of the art ; I have observed, on other occasions, they have great quickneSs, ahd JustneSs of sight-, with a most extraordinary faculty oS imitation; and for every other point requisite to excel-leTrcy in thefe performances ; thoSe who stod'y in Italy may acquire them, and have the' Same advantage oS the light in this country ; though I should imagine that is not fo iieeeffary Sor this style of painting, as landSchapes, and wherever a delicacy css perspective makes a great part of the beauty of the picture. I have Seen fome sine portraits by Mig-ftafd, and other celebrated painters in France by accident, but never Sought fat them, as however great their perfection may be, they have no merit, nor are otherwile antusing, than one is acquainted

quainted with the perSons reprefented. An Italian -Antiquarian accuses she French, and us too, of a defect in taste,, and of our ideas oS the beauties requisite to Sorm painters, &c. and even to
judge of their. excellencies, with re-„ gard to the French it may in Some de-; gree be true, they have it not in general ideas to Succeed in oicstures of ima-
. A.
ginatiom I have heard a perSon described of exquisite beauty, according, .-to their notions ; avec un air impo-,fant,des yeux noirs grands comme ceux .du Roi, et un petit nex-tgurne'en * flair. If they have, taken up ' Some ^part of this description as a compliment to the King, they'.do not Succeed; his Majesty’s featuresare too well adapted to his Sex, for any one to be plea-»sing in a woman, according to''the-■■general
[ i9° ]
neral idea of female perfection. As to ‘ us, no Italian should think the English taste defective; as near as possible we form it by theirs. Nor did I ever hear Englishmen accused of being insensible to Italian beauty. If we have no models at home, we seek and study theirs in all the arts and fciences for which they are celebrated, We do not, like the French, pretend to have a music of our own, but court and imitate the Italian. As to living models, though the English faces may vie with any, and furpafs most in exquisite complexion, and delicacy of features, they have not fo generally, the vivacity and expreffivenefs of the Italian countenances, yet without being lefs agreeable. But when I consider to whom I am addressing myself, I can easily allow, that

LETTER LI.
I AM this moment returned Srom viewing the triumphal arches; as I imagined, that at Orange has prevented? any great effect, though perfectly plain, and theSe very much ornamented. I SuppoSe the circumstances in which the arch at Orange was erected, did not

or if it ever had any decorations, time has destroyed them. The arch at O* range has the advantage oS being the only noble object Sor Some leagues'; in Rome the eye is accustomed to great-4 neSs. IS my pleaSure did not riSe very high with regard to theSe pieces oS antiquity, in general, I had a Singular and,exquisite Satisfaction in beholding the arch' of Titus. Every monument of this excellent Emperor, is a justice rendered to his fuperior virtue, and at the fame time presents the most perfect model to fucceeding princes. I have often reflected with astonishment, Kings should be fo generally complimented by the name of Augustus, and seldom by that of Titus : I fear more have been like the former, than the latter ; but truth does not determine the panegyrist : therefore I conclude it is the
k fame
[ 193 ]
fame given to Augustus by the poets. Yet fure the Delicke generis humanis, from the voice of the people, is more glorious than all the praife which flattery can invent. What a Superiority, in every reSpect, has Titus over August tus ! The former received his power from virtue, Succession, and election ; the latter from an usurpation, Savoured by the friends of his uncle, and Secured by the most conSummate cruelty, as long as that vile quality was convenient, when clemency became more So ; Sor this, and no other, reaSon he uSurp-cd that virtue, as he had done the throne. How different Titus, every action of his life proclaimed ; and when, with tears, he Said, I have lost: a day, he might, with justice, Scorn all other praiSe. The magic power of poets may raise a shadow where there VOL. II.	O	is;

Titus required Hot their art ; he knew, if even the thought was not beneath his greatneSs, possessing virtue herielf, fame, whom others courted, must follow him, to her I leave thoSe here, and go to the Collosseum : this amphitheatre is larger than that at Nifmes, having had feats Sor SourScore thou Sand, the other twenty; the building is likewiSe more elegant ; yet the remains at Nifmes being much greater, the effect is higher, and a better idea conveyed.—This moment I receive a letter, which calls me to England : I propoSed infinite pleaSure Srom the music oS the holy week, and a farther indulgence, and improvement of my taste Sor paintings and antiquities ; but, as I am returning to your Society, I shall be much more compensated Sor all the agremens and
beautieS:
[ 195 ]
beauties I leave at Rome. The most pleasing sight that can engage attention, is a beautiful face; and the most exquisite harmony, the voice of her one loves. With these sentiments, in a higher degree, and with greater sensibility than La Bruyere ever possessed them, I am,
