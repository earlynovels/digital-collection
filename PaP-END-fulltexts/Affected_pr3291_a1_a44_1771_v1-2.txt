THE
AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE,
A SENTIMENTAL HISTORY.
LETTER the First.
Lady FRANCES CONNER 
TO
Miss H E R B E R T.

Tis a surprising thing, my dear
Bab, that people will not let me alone. — I have told Lord Altringham a thousand times, that I do not
chuse to be married at all, yet he will not believe that I am in earnest. As I have

2 The Affected Indifference.
have refused so many men, why will he imagine that he shall persuade one ? Does he fancy himself younger, handsomer, and even wiser than any of the men who have hitherto addressed me ? Suppose I admit his superiority with regard to youth, beauty, and wisdom; may I not, at the same time, reject him even on account of that superiority which is, he imagines, the strongest recommendation? —He may not be so old as I am; and if he is younger he will be too young.— Every husband ought to be master of his family; but can a meer boy have a very magisterial appearance with a well-grown woman for his wife ? — As to handsome men I have no sort of propensity to them: they are extremely apt to be self-sufficient, and to expect more esteem and regard than they can rationally demand: and as to a man who thinks himself
wiser
The Affected Indifference. 3
wiser than his neighbours, I set that man down for a fool.
You see now I have advanced several substantial reasons for not listening to Lord Altringham’s addresses; you cannot, therefore, imagine that I shall give him encouragement. — You, who know my dislike to a change of situation, will not wonder at my remaining as I am. — There are so few men with whom I could be happy, that I really think I should run too great a risque by running into another state — and to what end after all? Am I not happy in my present condition? Can any body assure me that I shall be happier when I am married? — Are there not a thousand chances against me? Would I be more than happy? "The Italian proverb naturally occurs to me upon this occasion;
4 The Affected Indifference.
sion; I was well, would be better, took physick, and died."
Besides, I cannot, without the greatest absurdity, think of marrying, as I have not yet seen the man whom I can love. Indeed, Bab, the men are all entirely spoilt; and chiefly, by the ill conduct of the women. In general, we make ourselves so cheap that they despise us; and can we blame them? For my part I do not — while the women are so vain, so trifling, so forward; while they spend their time wholly in dissipation and dress, how can they expect to gain the esteem, or preserve the affection of those to whom they are united ? In short, I begin to think that there will soon be neither marrying nor giving in marriage. Let the women then mend themselves first : when they are the character they ought to be, they may, with propriety enough,
expect

The Affected Indifference. 5
expect to find themselves imitated by the men. Yet the most exemplary behaviour on the side of the wife is not always sufficient to endure her the felicity she wishes, or even what she deserves to enjoy. Poor Lady Haverford ! —-- has she a single fault? She has not yet, however, been able to keep the heart of the man whom she is bound to love and obey : bound ! do I say ? How can we tie ourselves up to love with unshaken constancy the man who marries us ? --- Is it not better not to be married at all?
What answer will my dear Bab return to

Her ever-affectionate FRANCES CONNER?

LETTER the Second.
The Hon. EDWARD WALSINGHAM
"TO
CHARLES D’ARCY Efqr.
I HAVE been so crouded with friends since my arrival, that I could not, till this day, seize a single moment to write to you — unquestionably you expect to find me, in this letter, giving an account of myself — but indeed I am not able to answer your expectations, for my last night’s visit to Lady H------ has
quite obliterated every thing which passed in my mind, from the time of my arrival at Dover.
You
The Affected Indifference. 7
You will be exceedingly Surprised at this information, because you da not want to be told that I have no particular propensity to her Ladyship.

"Why then hurry to her house before you spoke to those friends to whom you are more affectionately attached ?"
I'll tell you, D’Arcy—When I left
Paris, Lord H------'s brother. Col. S—,
who was there, desired me to deliver a pacquet to my Lady, as it contained something very curious, which he was unwilling to put into other hands. I, therefore, hastened to execute my commishon.
Her Ladyship’s assembly night was the very night I happened to fix upon for the delivery of my pacquet.
There were very elegant groupes of young people of both sexes at her house. The women, indeed, were so remarkably	
B 4 hand-

8 The Affected Indifference.-
handsome, that I could not help telling Tryon, in a whisper, I had not seen so many beautiful creatures together since my departure from England.
He allowed that many fine girls figured before us, but added — “ You have seen Lady Frances Conner, I Suppose. " 
“ Not I—Is she handsomer than any of these women ?"
“ Oh! infinitely—no comparison— she is an angel to look at, but as cold as a vestal:—a statue—she is one of thofe women whom every man loves, but who loves no man."
“ Surely such a woman cannot expect to be loved! I am not fond of a woman who is ready to fly down my throat; but I have no idea of being enamoured with an Insensible. I should as soon think of making addresses to a marble Venus."
Floyer
The Affected Indifference. 9
Floyer came behind us just at that moment:-“ Who are you talking of?" said he.
“ Lady Frances Conner."
“ Divine Lady Frances !" replied the Colonel: “ have you not seen her, Wal-Singham ?"
“ No."
“ Then you have not the least conception of what is beautiful in woman. But she is more than a common beauty: her understanding is equal to her person, and her manners are as polite as her wit is pointed."
I	turned, immediately, to examine the circle around me, to see if their charms, could be, possibly, surpassed. — The door opened, and a figure entered which excited all my attention. Her person was striking, but the graces with which her every look and motion were accompanied, B 5	are

10 The Affected Indifference.
are beyond the power of description. Willingly would I endeavour to do justice, but I cannot attempt to make you sensible of the harmony of her voice, or of the spirited expression in her charming eyes. She is of an agreeable height and size: her complexion is clear and bright: her face is pleasingly oval. Her eyes are long, dark, and dazzling; and sometimes a delicious languor is dif-used over her lovely countenance—her eye-lashes are long: her nose is strait,
but her mouth-----there I must drop the pencil. Her hair is of a dark ches-nut—she does not defile it with powder, but dresses it in a very becoming—if not very fashionable style. Take her for all in all, I never saw a finer young creature. Her conversation is quite equal to her person : I had an opportunity to hear her talk a great while to a Mr.
Ashbury,

The Affected Indifference. 11
Ashbury, who is, they say, dying for her: (but they also add that she has refused him.) She replied to him with a sweetness which must, certainly, make him adore her. She has no airs, no vanity, not a grain of affectation—un-less she affects to be indifferent to me: and I heartily wish that her indifference may be only affected.
'Tis a strange thing, D’Arcy, that there should be no medium in the behaviour of the sex to us: they are all frost, or all fire—I am sorry to declare that most of the women with whom I have been acquainted have been as much too forward as this Lady seems too re-served.—Not that there is any fault in her carriage in company; but if she, really, has no passions, no tender passions at least, she must be of a very unaccountable disposition, and a person
B 6	to
1
12 The Affected Indifference.-,
to whom one would not wish to be attached however, do not imagine that I alarm myself about Lady Frances: I am not, in the smallest degree, inclined to be in love with her : I look on her as a beautiful, as a pleasing object; I look on her as I do on a capital picture, —She is, indeed, the last woman I should be tempted to love—she is — I cannot explain myself— she appears to me, some how, too much out of the common road. She is so evidently superior to the majority of her sex, that she inspires rather respect than tenderness. I ad-mire her, but feel not the least propensity to love her.
I was saying so, during the course of the evening, in a whisper, to Tryon.
He laughed, and replied, “ You are rather singular in your opinion; but there is no accounting for taste."
Now,
The Affected Indifference. 13
Now, will you not think that I have taken up a great deal too much of my time and paper, in writing about a woman for whom I do not care a single six pence?—To change the Subject, therefore, when shall you come to town ? I am impatient for a meeting, having a thousand things to communicate, which I cannot set down at present.
Yours sincerely, 
EDWARD WALSINGHAM.

LETTER the Third.
Lady FRANCES CONNER
T O
Miss HERBERT.
I A M exceedingly out of humour;
not with you my dear, nor with any body else but mySelf; and yet I cannot
tell
14 The Affected Indifference.
tell why; I can only say that I wish I was any other person.
You will, most probably, exclaim at this unexpeded declaration; but I am actually serious.
' I was at Lady H--------’s assembly last night, and found a very agreeable party; —I was desired to distinguish a Mr. Wal- Singham just returned from his tour through Europe—he is a handsome fellow to be sure, sensible and well-bred; and yet I don’t know how, there was such a strange negligence about him — he seemed to overlook us all his behaviour, however, was extremely polite: I never saw finer eyes, teeth, and hair, and yet, a something was wanting.—-In short, I believe I wish to find fault with him, and am at a loss in what manner to begin.
You
The Affected Indifference.
You may, perhaps, imagine that this pretty fellow had not, in a crowded room, an opportunity to shew himself to advantage.—He shone with so much lustre that every other man was eclipsed, was nothing before him. He seemed intimate with Lord Tryon, who begged leave to introduce him to me.
I could not civilly refuse such an in-troduction you know, and, therefore, prepared myself to receive him with great good humour; but the easy nonchalance with which he accosted me was so totally unexpedled, that I felt myself disconcerted : I was absolutely embarrassed. Indeed, Bab, I never felt myself So awkward in my life, nor did I ever look so ill—Bland suffered not a little for my disappointment; for when I came home I quarrelled with her in earnest for letting me go out such a figure. To mend

mend the matter, before I was ready to be seen this morning. Lord Haverford brought the very man into my dressing room, telling me, with that sarcastical laugh for which he is so famous, that he came to introduce a particular friend of his to me just arrived from Italy: there, however, his Lordship was out, for Walsingham arrived last from Paris; yet he has not caught the silly manners, with which his imitating countrymen are so apt to expose themselves during, their stay in that capital.—----I must own, though I do not altogether like him, that nothing of the coxcomb appears in him.
Why should Lord Haverford take the liberty of bringing men into my apartment ?
I mentioned, with some degree of warmth, the vexation which I felt on
being

being taken by surprise, to my lady; but she, dear, good, gentle creature, cannot hinder my Lord from doing any thing he has a mind to. “ I fancy, " replied she, “ that my Lord thinks you and Mr. Walsingham would be suitable to each other, and wishes to bring you together.”
Believe me, my dear, I was still more provoked at this strange apology for my Lord’s freedom— Why should he give himself the trouble to find out who will suit me, and who will not ?—Really he is too officious; impertinently so. Can he suppose that I, who have rejected so many men, though the proofs of their sincerity were indisputable, shall ever think of a man forced upon me by my guardian? Lord Haverford, as a guardian, has a right to advise me; but he has no right to compel me, he has no right 

18 The Affected Indifference.
right to make any attempts to bring me over to his choice.—-Besides, I am very sure that this man is totally indifferent about me: not that I should be biassed in his favour if—what I mean to say is, that Mr. Walsingham has a coldness, a negligence in his manner which makes me look upon him as the last mamSulceptible of an attachment to any woman.—How different is his temper from Ashbury’s ? One would not imagine that they were of the Same Species.
I wish I could perSuade Ashbury to give up all hopes of me; but he will persist in following me every where..
He lent up his name while Walling-ham was with me—I ordered John to Say I was engaged.—That was a good hint, I thought, for the other to take but it did not prove effeflual. I even fancied that he was more determined, to
stay
The Affected Indifference. 19
stay than he was before, he certainly grew more lively and entertaining.

Was there ever Such a Goth to tell me So before a room full of his company I coloured up to the very eyes: I thought I never should be cool again. Whether WalSingham liked or dissiked me. Lord Haverford’s behaviour was extremely rude; but Some men have a conSummate assurance. I did not know which way to look.
Lord Tryon too was preSent: they,' both. Smiled and whiSpered — at my embarrassinent, I SuppoSe. I always imagined that Lord Tryon was a gentleman, though I have long known Lord Haverford to be a brute.—My Lady threw down her Sweet eyes as if she

Frances’s '
22 The Affected Indifference.^
Frances’s dressing-room: she lives with him and Lady Haverford: the latter is her relation, and a very amiable woman.
Lady Frances looked, I 'thought, both disconcerted and angry at the fight of me: my appearance ^ was certainly abrupt, but I was not anSwerable for it. I could not, however, be diSpleafed, becauSe I was gratified with the fight of a fine woman in one of the most elegant dishabilles I ever Saw; yet there was a -carelefsneSs in her dreSs, which plainly discovered that she intended not to have been fiirpriSed in it. Lord Haverford should not have favoured me in a manner displeasing to her: there was no occasion .for Such an unpolite proceeding. She had a glow upon her face wshich added new beauties to it. At first, I imputed her colouring to anger, but I
changed

t
The Affected Indifference. 23
changed my opinion afterwards, and fancied that it arofe from embarraffment —yes, D’Arcy, she was enchantingly embarrassed.
While I was with her, the Servant announced her lover Ashbury.
After having given the Servant orders to tell him that she was engaged, she behaved with more eaSe: she was not only leSs diSconcerted, but quite con-verSible.
In short, I was induced, by her behaviour and conversation to stay longer than I had designed.
When my Lord waited on me to the door, he ashed me if I would be of their party to the opera the next night. He is going down to Haverford-hall for the holidays, and insiSts upon my improving his let of friends who have promised to join him there with my comr-

■neSs^; singularity Savours of affedlation —I therefore attached mySelf to a very agreeable girl, a MiSs Herbert, the friend of Lady Frances, most undoubtedly almost as far above the common run of her Sex, as hei* Ladyship is.— Babi— (that is her'” name) lives I find the greatest part of the year at Windfor; she is now in town only for a few days upon a visit.	j
Bab, though not So regular a heauty as her inSenSible friend, is a very pretty woman, tall, fair, and blue-eyed. I chatted
with her, at intervals, a good deal-----
In the middle of a Song of Giardini’s, extremely pathetic, I turned my eyes accidentally on Lady Frances. Never had I beheld a face and figure So af-fedlingly alluring. She appeared to be quite melted at the musick: her head rested upon her handj Soft sighs issued

from her heaving boSom, and pearly drops stole down her blushing cheeks. She averted her face on my gazing at her, as if she was fearful of having committed a fault; but, furely, to be alive to the most, enchanting passions, is to discover no Small degree of merit. The heart which is touch’d by the Sorrows of another will not, it may be imagined,' purpofely, give pain to any human
creature.---No—^she cannot be an in-
* Sensible. And yet they tell me that, not a man has, hitherto, been able to inspire her with love. On the contrary, I am informed that she glories in her indifference.—We will leave her, therefore.
I wonder I have not Seen Burton, or heard of him, since I came to England. Tryon tells, me that he has taken a woman into keeping who has almost

ruined his fortune, and who bullies him in Such a manner that he is afraid to See any of his friends. However, as I am not afraid to encounter this formidable ' female, I intend to make him a visit before I go to Haverford-hall, and See if I cannot prevail on him to come among us again. He was a good-natured, agreeable fellow when I left him. How much does he injure himfelf, and of how much pleaSure does he deprive the world, by living thus Secluded from Society with a creature whom he is ashamed to introduce to his friends, and whom he dares not turn off!—I do not think that a man can give a stronger proof of the imbecility of his mind, than I by attaching himfelf to Such a woman. He lives, I am told, in the neighbourhood of Windsor: I shall, therefore, have an opportunity, perhaps, to make C 2	mySelf

To be Sure I am a very singular creature—I do not believe there is any woman like me: I dct not, at this moment, know a man whom I could love; and, I am, probably, a great deal happier than thoSe who have a vast quantity of Sensibility. — Poor Lady Haverford! what infinite vexation does she endure from the exceSs of her affedlion for my Lord; who feels, I am *^raid, a very night regard for her I

It was not neceffary for him, you know, to make Such a diScloSure merely for the fake of Speaking his mind freely about me. As I never expetsted any particular civisities from him, he had no occasion to give himSelf the trouble to tell my Lord how disagreeable I was to him.

in his behaviour to you; that his visit was short, ancT that he has not made a fecond. I expecsted a different account of him. Here is a report in town, that he went to lee a mistreSs whom he keeps not many miles from WindSor: they fay that she has a daughter by him, and that he has placed her at a boarding-School in the neighbourhood.—He must have been attached to this woman before he left England, or he could not have had a daughter old enough to go to School.
> I thought,, by Lord Haverford’s fond-ncSs for him, that their characters were fimilar: and since things are So, my dear Bab, I would not wish you to marry him. By finding the man of our choice, attached to a raistrefs, after marriage, we are cruelly disappointed; but by chusing the man who has, we know, long kept one, we a6t madly indeed..
I have
The Affected Indifference. 33;
I have long attributed the greatest part of the evils with which matrimony is attended to our own wrong condu<5t. We are, most of us, in So violent a hurry to change our condition, that we do not give ourSelves time to refie<5b upon the unhappy conSequeitces which may reSult from a hasty proceeding.^— We are too apt to listen to the civil Speeches addressed to us by. men with whom we have only a publick acquaintance, and either to construe their civilir^ ties into declarations in our favour, or ta make the first advances. — The. first advances,. on. our side, can never be made with propriety;, and. she whoSe forwards neSs runs away with her discretion, ought to be punished for it..
It has long been my opinion, mydear. Bab,. that men and women, both, would be more happy than we commonly See C 5	them,,
34 The Affected Indifference.,
them, if they had fewer conDeclions together. You Smile; but indeed I am not in jest, I am, every day, more and more convinced that we only plunge ourSelves into numberlefs troubles, which we never should have experienced, bjr our eagerneSs to look out for lovers—* -and we throw ourSelves in the vray of keener vexations in our Search after hushands.—^Hushands are generally tyrants, or totally indifferent about us when they have been married a little while: and their unhappineSs after marriage frequently ariSes from the connexions into which they enter with women of no principles or reputation, who think only about the prefent moment, and make the enjoyment of /to, fit any rate, the whole concern of their lives.—A W’oman of virtue, therefore, cannot too nicely inSpeX into the disposition

position of a man before she is married-to him, nor shut her eyes against his temper too cloSely afterwards, if it happens to be a bad one.
I have been told, a hundred times, that Lord Haverford was the most tender and fubmishve of lovers; and he is, you know,, far from being the most affedlionate of hushands.- Lady Haverford is, how'^ever, the most obedient of wives :—but I have heard his Lordship fay that a meer, tame, houSehold dove is the most insipid of ail charadters t and that a wife who affefbs to be loving^ is Surfeiting beyond expression... Thus,, you See, Bab, that to a man of this strange cast you would not appear ima meritorious light, by a quiet and complying behaviour : with Such a man indeed, you have not the Smallest chance for happineSs r * and pray tell me, where will you find a C 6.	man^.

Lord Altringham, humble, and Submissive as he now is, would, I dare Say, im a very short time, follow Lord Haverford’s example. Nay„ I aftually believe that the sighing Ashbury, were he married, woistd Soon become either inconstant or indifferent..
Before you attempt to contradict theSe assertions, let me beleech you to look round among your married friends then, tell me whether I have been too. levere. If I have who, in her fenSes, would marry with So many chances-against her ?

Lady FRANCES, CONNER.
I HAVE So. often endeavoured to perSuade you to have a better opinion of the men, my dear Lady Frances, and to So little purpoSe, that I have long despaired of bringing you over to my way of thinking.
With regard to Lord Altringham and Mr. Ashbury,. I have nothing more to^ add to what I have Said about them a thouSand times : but Walfingham must not be‘ put upon the Same footing with them. He is Superior, in every refpetst,.
to
38 The Affected Indifference.
to thoSe, or any other men I have- ever Seen. There can be no Sort of comparison between them. One rarely Sees a man with So sine a perSon, with So excellent an understanding, and with So large a fortune, free from haughtinefs. or affedlation ; free from inSolence and Self-conceit. I do not, however,, pretend to fay that Mr. Walsingham is fault-leSs; but I verily believe that he has fewer failings than any of his Sex at his time of life, and in Ms situation in the world: nay, I am really of opinion that your Sentiments correspond with mine about him..
You are piqued,, my dear, becauSe a man So univerSally admired has made no particular addreSs to you., that’s all. Were he to profeSsv himSelf your lover, you would,, certainly, rejeD him, merely to have the pleaSure of faying that you

The Affected Indifference. 39^
rejected him.—Now I really think this is ooino; too far. That men have a number of foibles and weakneffes, I am very ready to allow; and I am afraid that there are Some whom the best of women could not reform—yet thefe are only a few, and generally,, the least agreeable; as he must be of a strange difpoSitioni who will not yield to reaSon, though it should happen to come from the mouth of a wife. Tou and Lady Frances, are in no danger of falling into the hands of Such a man: but we ought, nevertheless, to acknowledge merit where-we really find it, and.reward it if it is in our power. And I affure you I have So high an opinion of rny own Sex—(I hopo I do not overrate theni) as to believe; that we are very well qualified to contribute greatly to the happineSs of thoSe
men

men to whom alone we ought to be united.
In Spite of all the reports circulated against Mr. Walsingham, I am ready to defend him: however, I- will make it my buSineSs to enquire farther—In the mean while, I cannot help imagining —don’t be angry with me—that you would be extremely glad to lee So amiable a man at your feet, and in the list of thoSe who- are most lerioussy, most affedlionately attached to your Ladyship.,

whom he has hitherto kept as his daughter.
WalSingham left nothing.undone to convince him of the infidelity of his mistreSs, and of the numberleSs indiScretions which she committed: and not oitly prevailed with him to part with her, but to let him take care of her daughter; telling him that if he Suffered his daughter to be under the diredlion of her mother, she would certainly make her like her-Self; and that if he‘ kept the girl with Nw, ‘she would undoubtedly be Spoilt, as Ho man, without the assistance of a well-bred fcnfible woman could, poS-Sibly, educate a daughter in the manner she Jhould be educated.
In this way Mr. Walsingham, I have been informed, talked to his friend, who, in conSequence of his arguments and perSuafions, turned off his mistrefs,

WalSingham, having brought MiSs Burton to town with him, placed her with an old Lady who was a friend of his mother’s, and he has ordered proper masters of all kinds to attend her.
And now, my dear, pray what fault can you find with this man ^ Is he not vastly Superior to the common herd of pretty fellows ? For my part I am quite charmed with his behaviour on the above-mentioned occafion, and I am no leSs struck with your generosity, upon which I could expatiate with as much pleaSure, were I not afraid of wounding your delicacy.

of the most amiable part of his character: for. Surely, to make people Sensible of their errors, and to induce them to corredl them, is to be engaged in a very commendable employment: to prevent innocent girls from falling into bad hands, is to diScover a godlike disposition.—Now, Lady Frances; I give you leave to become enamoured with, this exemplary man as Soon as you pleaSe.—Such a man will not trouble himSelf about the diminution of your fortune, or the increaSe of it: Such a man can never be Swayed by lucrative considerations.

to leave Lord Haverford’s houSe, though - i;shail be exceedingly Sorry to part from my Lady ; but I hope to reconcile her to. my departure Soon, by telling her that as my marriage—for which she is -very urgent—must necessarily occasion a Separation between us, it is better to wean ourSelves from each other before that event. It is not my design, indeed, to be niarried at all; but I cannot tell how to procure her conSent by any other mode of proceeding.

I Smiled, and replied, “ Few girls are now trained to make good women. Sir.”
He assented to that assertion—“ However, Lady Frances,” continued he^ “ Since the happineSs of our lives, which ought to refult from our domestic connexions, depends entirely upon the proper education of your fex, can we be

Who, indeed, would not, with the least encouragement, hope for a return of his paf-fion She has, I will venture to affirm, the most elegant taste in drels I ever beheld in woman; at least, the charms of her perfon, and the delicacy of her , manners render every drels becoming—

fully in motion. Every feature receives an additional power of allurement from '
every attitude.---But to what purpoSe
should I wish to dwell on thoSe charms ' to which I must not afpire ?—Let me cliange the Subjedt.
The houSe is full, and—what is most extraordinarythe company is agreeable, lively, chearful, and entertaining in general. Some odd charadters, indeed, are intermixed, which make a pleasing variety, and Serve to Set off the others.
We have Mr. and Mrs. Lumley here —Mr. Lumley is a downright humourist; he is Several years older than his wife, and in conSequence of his Seniority, concludes that he is in possession of more knowledge. Mrs. Lumley, with a very good understanding, and lively to excefs, is of a different opinion—they do not absolutely quarrel,
but
I
i
68 The Affected Indifference.
but they differ in Such a manner as to -afford much mirth for the entertainment of the rest of the company.. . : v
I never think of the Lumleys, without refiecsting upon the marriages between people widely different in their tastes and dispositions — and- without condemning them Severely; for Such people . can only, one would imagine, j be influenced by mercenary motives to^ i unite themSelves for life.—Whenever I ' turn my thoughts towards matrimony, ' I shall be careful not talet the woman on whom I Settle my affedlions perceive how much I admire her, lest she should, either with a view to keep m© as a lover, or to deceive meefor her:diverfion, make concealments,. the discovery of which, after marriage, might render us both completely miferable, ,1.,;	•	'

Suppofe now Lady Frances should be as cautious as I intend to be on my side about the msh whom she intends to marry. She may, perhaps, put an all this indifference to throw him off his guard, and to make him appear as he really is.
This conjecflurc is not. Surely, a very abSurd one.—And if her Ladyship does " iidopt this mode of behaviour, I cannot blame her: she will but Square her con- ' ' dudl agreeably to my own plan.
i	-
You will tell me, it may be, that it is utterly impossible for us two to come together — you will tell me, tha<- if I design to marry, I must, look out for -Somebody elSec— I, certainly, do design to look out for a Suitable domestic companion, for I find thatithefociety of an amiable and converSible woman is absolutely necessary to my happinefs; and as
I find
yo The Affected Indifference. '
1 find alSo that I cannot esteem any woman who will live with me upon any other terms; there is nothing to be done but in the matrimonial way:—yet how prodigioussy hazardous is that way When I take a review of the married people about me, even of thoSe among my friends and acquaintance, I can with the greatest reafon assert, that he is a bold man who in this gay age ven- | tures to marry. I do not pretend to affirm that unhappy marriages, in general, are occasioned by the milbchaviour of bad wives: I can, with pleaSure, stand up in the defence of many married women: but if the younger part of the female Sex are not educated in another manner, I expe6l to See few marriages, and still fewer happy ones: I don’t know, indeed, whether I may not expeffc to fee
our
The Affected Indifference. 71
our estates Secured to our illegitimate children.
The Lumleys make me out of hu-mour with the marriage-state; but I am going to mention a couple, residing here,
, at prefent, who make me desirous of entering into it. Mr, and Mrs. Hotham ' are the happiest pair I ever met with: they have been married fifteen years, and yet—I never Saw a happier pair. Thoroughly Satisfied with each other, they endeavour to make themSelves thoroughly agreeable to every body about them: they are related to Lady ’ Haverford, who is herSelf the mildest,
the most----here I chuSe to stop. There
are men in the world with humours So unaccountable, that they had rather behave with tenderneSs to a Scolding mistreSs, than barely civil to the gentlest of wives.
We

We have Lord and Lady Touchet too. Colonel Haviland, Lady Ann Eustace, and idle, simple fellows, like my-Self, without number.
Lord Haverford talks of a maSque-rade ball. My Lady thinks that Such an entertainment will be more agreeable in the Summer, when the weather is favourable to rambles in the gardens and woods with which this place is fur- | ' rounded. A maSquerade,. however, having been mentioned before us all, every perSon, except Lady Frances and me, declared strongly for the preSent moment. My Lord, therefore, carried the day------by a considerable majority.
I was going to Send up orders for a habit, but I hear we are to have people from Tavistock Street with us, and So I may Save inySelf that trouble: I should only, indeed, have beSpoken a Domino:

not chusing to play the fool in earnest, by attempting to make my appearance in a charadter which I cannot, for want of h imour and taste, properly Support. BefidtJ, I am not at all fond of maSque-rades: I do not look upon them as amuSements which women can 'enjoy without receiving impressions Sufficient to hinder them from Jhining in the marriage-state.
Under proper regulations, you will Say, how can maSquerades be pernicious ? True—But pray tell me in what manner can they be uSeful ?—Why may , we not as well dance, and chat, and play at cards in our common dresses, -as looking likeTurks and Shepherds, Nuns and Sultanas} For my part, I hate all diSguiSes~Truth and daylight iox me.

I believe I have the honour to entertain Sentiments which correspond with thoSe of Lady, Frances upon this occasion, from what I heard her Say in a walk we had the other morning in the ‘ park. Lady Frances is not one of thoSc idle women who lie in bed till noon, and then only rife in order to creep to their toilets. She is up, and dressed at an early hour, and either walks or rides every morning when the weather is favourable; by So doing, she keeps herSelf in health, and preServes the enchanting bloom of her complexion, without having recourSe to Dr. H-------to

Lady Frances never engages in this mafculine diversion: right again.—I do not, it is true, love a woman who Screams at a Spider; or trembles at a breath of air; but I would have her in her taste and her manners perfetstly feminine.

Cecilia Sommers is not, however, remarkably fmall •, she is delicately made: ’'she has a very expressive countenance, pretty laughing eyes, a fine mouth, beautiful teeth, and a vivacity which borders upon wildneSs : yet that vivacity is accompanied with a Naivete abshlutely enchanting.

Mifs HERBERT,
WE had our ball last night, but I never was more tired of an entertainment in my life: it appeared to me to be excessively flat and insipid.
I danced with Walfingham; but we ' danced as So—ber—ly together as if we had been a couple of Quakers just arrived from Philadelphia.
You will, certainly. Say that my head is turned, my dear Bab—but I mean only that there pasted as little gallantry between us as if we had been brother E 5	and

and sister.. According to observations, he was not more lively with any other woman in the room.
As to Cecilia, she was out of her lit* tie wits.—By her innocent remarks, and by the joy which Iparkled in her eyes, she gave delight to every body about her.—Lord Tryon was her partner, and Seemed to be very much taken, with her. Should this penchant, on my lord’s fide grow into a real passion, I shall gladly pay my part of her fortune, as he appears to be as good as the young men of the age generally are — not excepting your favourite.
Cecilia would, I think, be more eligibly situated, if she was well married, than she can be at preSent. She wants the authority, care, and tendernefs, of a man capable of loving her : of a man, in short, whom she can herfelf love, to
keep
The Affected Indifference.. 83
keep her within bounds..- Not that, there is the least indiScretiondn her. carriage ;. but her Spirits Seem ready to hurry her into imprudences, and Some designing fellow may take advantage of her Ipright-^ lineSs and simplicity to impoSe upon her.
We had Several odd figures among us, but as the description of them would afford you Small entertainment, li shalL only miSpendT^y time, and take up too much of yours by attempting to de-^ fcribe them.—However, this I must fay for maJHed.balls^ if no-body is more elated with them than;I am,„ they will do no fort of miSchief.

I wore a Small white beaver upon my, hair, , with a pale pink feather: and they all told me tliat it Suited the colour of my hair, and became me prodigioussy.
Lady Frances danced with Mr. Wal-singham,, and. Lord Try on with me.

WERE I in a humour to write about balls, and a dabbler in description, I could^ give you a most flourishing one of our maScjuerade, fit to be printed in the Morning Chronicle : but I have other matters to mind.
This Lady Frances—^what a wonderful fine creature she is ?—she was drest in white; her lovely dark hair was adorned with brilliants. Your imagination cannot, possibly, paint a more beautiful obje<5t. No woman ever moved in a
. . minuet
90 The Affected Indifference.
minuet with Such exquisite grace ; she is rather too fober indeed, in cotillons and , country dances : I mention the word , - foher^ becaufe she herSelf made uSe of it more than once during the evening, while I had the honour of her hand : whether it was by way of recommendation or reproach, I have not been yet able to determine.
Cecilia, on the contrary, was all life • and Spirit: her graces were judicious, and elegantly varied ; but the giddy girl, through exceSs of vivacity, made now and then a faux-pas., blushed at it like a new-blown roSe, and begged me to Set her right with Such an innocent, engaging importunity, that I felt no Small pleaSure in giving her proper instructions. She is an amiable little gipSy.
Tryon was quite lost in a violent passion for her, ventured to mention his prepoS-
fessions
The Affected Indifference. 91
Sessions on her account to her, and to Solicit her favour.
What anSwer do you imagine she - returned ?
“ I am much obliged to you, my lord,” replied she, “ for your good opinion of me, but I have yet Seen So little of the world, that I may perhaps meet with Some perSon I like better than your lord-ship, and then you know we shall be both disappointed.”
* Tryon is chagrined at this reply ; but ' I think it was a very Sensible one. If all women, when they are addressed by us, would be as fair and as open, we should not fee So many unhappy couples draging their chains after them.
Mrs. Lumley Said it was an artful reply ; but I declare I think she is mistaken: I never beheld a more artleSs creature in my life. Tryon is of my

mind. Poor fellow ! he is quite gone ; he leaves nothing undone to win her; but she is more reServed to him than to any other man ; merely, I believe, be-caufe he professes himlelf her lover. She converfes with me with the freedom of a sister. I cannot expedl: So favourable a behaviour from lady Frances, who becomes more and more Serious and reServed every day.
We have got a miniature-painter a-mong us, an ingenious young fellow; he has a good deal of buSinefs when the company come down in the Summer; and as he is known to Lord Haverfbrd, his Lordship invited him to the hall.. He is taking all our faces, and will find them profitable to him-t while he gives pleaSure by his performances. The ladies are, at our request, drawn im the dresses in which they appeared on the

If she does not like Tryon, SuppoSe I Speak for Burton? Such a lovely girl will quite cure him of the least remnant of a paS-Sion for Mrs. Cary. Thus am I providing for others while no-body takes any care of me. lady Frances’s heart is absolutely'marble: not all the sighs of the tender Ashbury, who is really an amiable man, can melt her to love. What can / expetst then, who never sigh at all? Nothing to be Sure.

I Begin to wish I had left Cecilia where I found her. She is, I fear, of an obstinate temper. She has the luckiest opportunity of being advantageoussy married, and will not hear of it. Lord Tryon is young, handSome, possfest of a handSome fortune, and exceedingly fond of her ; and yet she refuSes hiiii—he desired me to uSe my interest with her. I not only talked to her, earnestly, mySelf, but wrote to Lady Mary, who has Sent her a long letter upon the Subjedt; but
she
The Affected Indifference. 95
she will not comply, she must certainly be destitute of Sensibility, and, if she i$, no man can be happy with her. And yet she Seems affedtionately attached to me : she weeps and Says, she will marry Lord Tryon to pleaSe me. I think, indeed, that she cannot do better; but I chuSe not to urge her to adl against her inclination : her heart, I believe, is engaged. I wish I had not taken her from her mother. Girls with Such volatile dispositions, never know what they would have. Were I to Send her back, she would imagine, perhaps, that I had Some defign in it. I am at a loSs how to condudl my-Self. I fancy I shall get nothing by interfering at preSent; but she has, by refusing So good an offer, fretted me So much, that I am quite out of Spirits.

and every body elSe. I am still persecuted by Ashbury, who will not take a denial. He is not like Lord Tryon, who, finding he could not Succeed, went to ' London syesterday; telling Cecilia, when he bade her adieu, that he loved her too . fincerely to improve his acquaintance with her, unleSs she would give him the encouragement he wished for.
I fat yesterday to a young painter, whom Lord Haverford patroniSes ; but I never looked So ill in my life.— I am quite fatigued with company.

WELL'—I have determined upon it at lash Humanity, compaS-sion, let me add love, have entirely vanquished me.
_	*	When
The Affected Indifference. 125
When I had read the marriage of Lady Frances in the papers, I endeavoured to compoSe my mind as well as I could : I endeavoured to forget what I could not remember without pain. I Spent my time chiefly with Burton, trying to per-Suade him to marry.
Hearing nothing from Lord Haver-ford, I called at his houSe to know if he was come to town.
The Servant told me that MiSs Sommers had been dangeroufiy ill of a fever, and that her illnefs had prevented the family from coming up.
I started; my tongue, involuntarily, articulated—“ Poor Cecilia! ”—I began to fancy that I had been, in Some degree, accessary to her diforder.—I was conScious, indeed, of. not having been intentionally So, yet I could not be quit© G 3	Satisfied
126 The Affected Indifference.
Satisfied with mySelf. A man who car-' ries his inclination, or even his gallantry far enough to give the ssightest uneafi-neSs to a woman of charader, can only repair his indifcreet—not to Say criminal, behaviour, by marrying her, if she will accept of him. The least he can do is to offer her his hand.
Will you not tell me, however, that I have given mySelf an imaginary importance ? Will you not tell me that I am a consummate coxcomb for Supposing that every woman is in love with me ?
Indeed you are' mistaken .D’Arcy; I never could bring mySelf to fancy that -the only woman in the world whom I wished to feel a tendrejfe for me, thought me tolerable. Be that as it may, I re-folved to go down to the hall, and to fee whether I was right in my conjedure or
nor.

not. Accordingly I Set out: but being overtaken on the road by my friend Orme, he insisted on my steeping with him So strenuousty that night at his houSe, witte in five miles of the place where he stopped me, that I complied, tho’ reluctantly, with his request.
In conSequence of my steeping at Oritie’s Houfe, I did not reach Haver-ford-hall till one o’clock.
The first Servant who appeared, informed me, that my Lord Set out for London that morning; and that my Lady, Lady Frances,, and Mr. Ashbury, were gone to take an airing in the coach. He then opened the parlour-door, and discovered Cecilia. She was Sitting in a penfive posture with her cheek upon her hand.
At the fight of me she started, and was, at first, pale and red, by turns : G 4	when
128 The Affected Indifference'.
when the beautiful roSy hue no longer animated her countenance, she looked more like a corpSc than a living crea-.ture.
Seating mySelf by her, I took her hand, which trembled exceedingly, in mine, and expressed great concern for her illneSs.
She blushed again, but thanked me, and Said, in a weak voice—“ How came we, sir, to have the pleaSure of feeing you So unexpectedly ? ”
“ I came on purpoSe- to See yon.^ MiSs Sommers,” replied 1. “ Having enquired after you, imagining you would have been in London long before this time, and heard that you had been Seized with a fever, I hurried hither, and am transported to find you, in appearance, much better than I expeCted.”
She
The Affected Indi,fference. 129
She bowed her head by way of acknowledgment ; opened her mouth to Speak, but cloSed it as if utterly unable to articulate a Syllable..
I Saw, with much anxiety, the violent agitation of her mind ; and was almost afraid to attempt to calm it in the only manner which would (I knew) prove ef-feistual. I therefore strove, by gentle and Scarce perceptible degrees, to lead her to the interesting point I wished, for her Sake, to arrive at. I was fearful of overpowering her Spirits by too precipitate a behaviour: yet I, at the Same time, perceived that she was racked with uncertainty on my account.
Thinking it best to go to work indk recstly, I told her, still pressing her hand— she had offered to withdraw it, but I gently detained it—“ that I had not kept the promiSe I made her. ”
G 5	' She
130 The Affected Indifference.'
She looked Surprised. Her SurpriSe anSwered my purpoSe ; I wished to draw off her tlioughts, for a moment, from a Subje6l which too much employed them, and Succeeded.
“ I have not mentioned you to my friend, my dear Cecilia, ” Said I, ‘‘ in the terms you deServe. I could not bring mySelf to mention you in tsioSe terms to him.—I was apprehenSive of his liking, you too well.
She replied, without raising her eyes, which were cast down, “ As you pleafe, sir.’" -
Would it then be agreeable to you,
Mifs Sommers, to receive the addresses of Mr. Burton ^ ”
‘	“ Oh no, ” anSwered she, eagerly.
“ I am happy to find our Sentiments the fame upon this Subject, my dear Cecilia:	'
for I canriot bear to think of your being

ing 'married to any man but mySelf. Am I not too prefumptuous ^ ”
Here I pauSed. Her face and neck-glowed like crimfon. She shook alb . over, as if she was in an ague-fit. At last, making a violent effort to withdraw her hand, she cried, in a faulter-ing voice—“ Do not laugh at me, Mr.
‘ ' WalSingham.”
She then roSe up, and attempted to^ walk out of the room.
^ I flew to her, and stopped her, by catching her in my arms. “ How can you, “Said I, ” think me capable of turning the most Serious adlion of my life into raillery?—No, my dearest girl, I Swear, by every thing most Sacred, that if you will accept of me, I will be yours by the strongest, ties. I will wait on Lady Mary as Soon as I have gained your permission, and Settk every thing G 6	in
132 The Affected Indifference.'
in the most expeditious—I flatter mySelf too—SatisfaDory manner. Speak, my Cecilia ; tell me. Shall it be So ? ”
I Spoke, I called upon her to no pur-poSe, she was motionleSs in my arms.
, Fearing that she might have been too mlich affeCted by the declaration I had made, and fearing that she might have felt Some new uneaSineSs, as she certainly was not perfedlly recovered from her late disorder, I was both pained and alarmed, but did not chuSe to Summon any body to my assistance, till the last extremity ; imagining that the preSence of a third perSon might increaSe her confusion, and lay her under a disagreeable restraint: I, therefore, carried her to a fopha, feated mySelf by her, laid her head on my boSom, and began to rub her hands and her temples.—By So doing, 1 Soon rouSed her: she opened
her
The Affected Indifference. 133
her eyes, looked at me. Sighed, and cloSed them again.
Animated, with the hopes of her recovery, I ventured to preSs her sips, and then intreated her to tell me she was better if she found herSelf So, as I had Suffered a great deal from feeing her So much disordered.
She attempted to raiSe herSelf up, but I still held her, and repeatedly assured her that I would ever be hers, if she would accept of me.
“ Accept of you, Mr. Walsingham !” replied she — and burst into a flood of tears.
Her tears increaSed my distreSs: I thought there would be no end to it. I conjured her to tell me why she wept, to inform me whether I had Said any thing disagreeable to her-—“ If 1 have
given
/
1^4 The Affected Indifference.
given you pleafure, my dear girl,” con- * tinned I, “ why theSe tears”
Be not offended with me,” anSwered she, still weeping; “ for my tears are occasioned by exceshve joy and gratitude.”
What humility, D’Arcy ! What ten-derneSs ! What ravishing Sensibility ! Is not Cecilia the right Sort of girl for a wife?—And yet, to my shame I Speak it, Icould have been glad to have placed Lady Frances in the room of this amiable young creature, even at the very moment I So exceedingly admired her.
No traces, however, of my thoughts appeared either in my looks or adlions : I discovered nothing but Satisfadtion, and endeavoured to mix as mucfi delicacy with my tenderneSs as I possibly could; becauSe I Saw she was embarrassed, and Seemed to be overwhelmed with what
she
/
The Affected Indifference. 135
she called, excessive generosity on my side., —Surely, my friend, I have been only generous to mySelf in engaging mySelf to a woman who, if she loves and esteems me as much as she declares she * does, is of inestimable value. Let me, therefore, study to be deServing of So much tenderneSs and affedion, and to return it in a manner the most likely to make her happy.
Before the family came back, she grew Somewhat more calm: they appeared Surprised to fee me. I told Lady Haver-ford that her long residence at the hall had occasioned my Second viSit to her.
I then paid my compliments of congratulation to Lady Frances, and Mr. Ashbury.
The former blushed, and looked almost like an angel. I Seized her hands, and Softly intreated her to Speak in my
favour
136 The Affected Indifference^
favour to Lady Mary Sommers, that I might gain her charming daughter MiSs ' Cecilia.
Lady Frances’s cheeks glowed with a. higher lustre at this request,, and her hands trembled in mine. I quitted her to return to Cecilia who looked So Sweetly bashful, with a kind of tender timidity, that she was absolutely irresistible, and inSpired both love and compassion.
Lady Frances, who had alSo, to my extreme SurpriSe, been visibly diScon-certed, recovered herSelf Sufficiently to expreSs her Satisfaction at the compliment I had paid Mifs Sommers; adding, that she would write to Lady Mary upon the occasion.
I have nothing now to do, but to take all possible care to re-establish my poor Cecilia’s health, which was very indifferent before she was thrown into the
violent
The Affected Indifference, rjy
violent agitation of Spirits above-men- ' tioned: and she would have been probably worSe, had she not been informed of my intentions in her favour; as I have almost brought her to own that her illneSs was entirely on my account: she has Scarce lifted up her eyes to me since that confession but by stealth, as if they were ashamed to meet mine.
To morrow I am to wait on Lady Mary. Thus you fee matrimony can no longer be avoided by.

SO — I thought where it would enff.
Your favourite has, at last,«pitched upon Cecilia. She recovered at the first sight of him. The girl is intoxicated with joy: she absolutely deifies him. Never was there a man So beloved : but then, my dear Bab, no man, perhaps, ever So much merited the affecstion which is discovered for him^ He ought to be a pattern to all lovers for his behaviour to her. There is a delicacy blended with his tenderneSs, a
refine-
The Affected Indifference. 141
nefinement in his addreSs which I never observed in any other mane I believe he is excessively fond of her. You have often heard me Say that Cecilia, Setting aside her perSon, was a very engaging girl: yet I may confeSs, between our-Selves, that I should not have imagined her to be quite the Sort of woman to charm WalSingham. She is exceedingly pretty, indeed, and pleasing in her manners : she has a good understanding, and does not want Sensibility, but still I think she is not properly qualified to charm Such a man as Walsingham by her conversation. ConScious, perhaps, of his own uncommon powers, he has chofen a woman on account of her rea-dinefs to listen to him with attention, and to admire every word which falls from his lips—But I wrong him ; he has not the ssightest tindture of the coxcomb

in him: he is always more diSpoSed to do justice to the merit of another, than to difplay his own. — Lady Mary approves : how can she disapprove of Such a man for her Son—He is alSo much pleaSed with her Ladyship, and declares himfelf delighted with the modest meek-neSs of her daughter Caroline.
Is it not Something odd that Mr. Wal-Singham, who has been in all the courts in Europe, who has Seen and converSed with the finest women in England, should find no lasting attractions but in I^ady Mary Sommers’s family ? They are certainly very agreeable people, but are there no women in the world equal to them ? Undoubtedly, there are, though they do not happen to be to his taste.

POSTSCRIPT.
While I went to Speak to Cecilia in the next apartment, Mr. Ashbury came into the room in which I had left my letter, and read it. He
tells
j44 The Affected Indifference.'
tells me that I have Spoken of your favourite in higher terms than ever, l He Seems to be extremely diSconcerted.
I should not have hinted this, did I not wish to know if I have really been guilty of any impropriety in Ipeaking highly of a man So generally esteemed, and who is going to pay one of my relations So great a compliment. I read over again the passages he alluded to, but I Saw no improper expressions in them. I told him that if ,he did not approve of what I had Said concerning Mr. Wal-fingham, I would alter it:' adding, how- ' ever, that as I had been writing to the friend of my earliest years, from whom I had not been accustomed to conceal my most Secret thoughts, I had Set them ffown as they occurred. He replied, sharply—They were, indeed, I believe, your most Secret thoughts”—-and hur-"	ried

LETTER the Thirty-fourth.. Mr. ASHBURY

^ Sir JAMES FERN.
My Suspicions were not grouitdleSs: but I wish I had kept them to mySelf. Lady Frances wrote in Such high terms of W-alfingham to her friend, that I could not bear the peruSal of her letter. I not only gratified my curioSity by that perufal, but I found fault with her letter.
She Said but little in reply: she changed colour, and the refentment which she VoL, I.	H	iaboureci
ij\.6 The Affected Indifference.
laboured to conceal, has convinced me that I was not mistaken; has convinced me, ( that the coldneSs of which I before complained, is changed into a fettled -aversion.
I was to blame — I was too hasty.
As'she never loved me, she greatly condescended sin consenting to a marriage which, r fear, has made us both completely wretched.
Could I but have waited with patience, till time had reconciled her to a step, which ’’she took, I verily believe, out of mere compassion for me, I might by degrees, perhaps, have gained her ' heart: my rashneSs has undone me. — Naturally high-Spirited, and entertaining a mean opinion of thoSe women who let themSelves down — to uSe her own words — and are too ready to yield themfclves to the first agreeable man whom chance throws in their way, she

She will never go unwarrantable lengths ' with any other man: but she may like another man better than me—Such an idea is distradting — I am distradted to think of my wife’s preferring another
man to me----But she must not See how
deeply I am diSquieted. She shall not See the storm which she has raiSed in my mind. I will conceal my feelings from her, whatever I Suffer from the Suppreff. Sion of them.

The generality of women are too eaSy: by improper compliances they render themfelves cheap in the .eyes of their lovers: they lessen the dignity of their Sex, and loSe all their conSequence : but when once a woman is married, she ought to behave in a very different manner.

There is a pleasure in making others happy, infinitely Superior to that which we feel on having done

any thing to promote our own felicity. My Cecilia convinces me of the truth of this assertion every hour — Never did any woman exprefs Such heartfelt SatiS-faclion. So much lively joy, as she has done since I mentioned my design with regard to her; and even now she is my wife, her tranfports know not any bounds.
We are with Lady Mary at preSent, who is as agreeable, the difference of years considered, as her daughters.
Sister Caroline, one of the best of girls, will make, I believe, one of tire best of wives to Burton, who has, on my recommendation, been introduced to her, not as a lover, but as my friend* Fie admires the gentleneSs of her difpofition, and the SoftneSs of her manners; doubly admires her for being So un-like Mrs. Cary; and Caroline Seems quite diSpoSed to fall in with ;whatever Lady Mary and H 4	her

She has never been in love like my Cecilia.:—*Tis very well.—Our fathers and mothers frequently tell us that stis no matter whether we are in love or not to a romantic degree, and that we shall be quite as happy- without it; and 1 can readily believe them. I was not myfelf in that situation; I am very well Satisfied, however, with my wife, whom I had certainly never married, had I not believed that I gave her encouragement, being struck with the beauty of her per-fon, and the innocent wildneSs of her carriage, to Suppole that I was fond of her. Had I not reSolved to aft like a man of honour, that behaviour of mine to her might have been attended with confequences injurious to her charafter; for though nothing in the least criminal passed between us, she would not, I

fancy, have permitted me to take im--prudent liberties with her—But a girl is hardly ever Safe who indulges herSelf too freely in a violent inclination for a man; for he.^ prompted by passion and opportunity, may be urged to forget what he owes her and himfelf, or Jhe may be thrown too^ much off her guard, and fall a vi(5bim to a tenderneSs which never should have been indulged till there can be no danger in the-indulgence of it.
There Seems to be a very stritst friendship between Lady Frances and my wife. Cecilia tells me that she loves her becaufe she is indebted tosher for. the happineSs which she. at . prefent-enjoys. Had it not been for Lady Frances,. indeed, she had never been acquainted with me; and I know that if Lady; Frances hlad shewn the Smallest inclination to. be married to me,.

Cecilia. She, undoubtedly, looked upon herSelf as ^engaged to Mr. Ashbury, and, therefore, very prudently forbore to flirt with any other man : but flirts, is not a proper expression; she does not Seem to have the Slightest propensity to any kind of gallantry. She is not So averSe to love, I imagine, as she appears to be; but Ashbury knows best her" aversions and her desires: they are a Serious, reServed couple, not So wild .and So volatile as Cecilia and her hujband.
As I would, on no account, deceive •any body, or affist in bringing two persons together who may, probably, make discoveries afterwards not at all agreeable ; I acquainted Lady Mary and her daughter with Burton’s former conec- , tion.

riage. Cecilia and she agree So well together, that I don’t know who is the most infantine of the two. LouiSa will make a fine woman and,, consequently, stand moi^ in need of a mother to introduce her into the world- Caroline will, I hope, be a mother to her whenever her father shall think proper to take her home, as it will be better to have her early accustomed to obey the perfon who is to Superintend her future condudt.^. * ' I cannot approve of the preSent mode of education for our daughters irt boarding Schools, at least, after a certain age. They learn nothing there but what they may learn any where elSe; and there is a great deal taught in them which can be of no Sort of Service to them.—If Burton, therefore, does not chule t:o take his daughter home after he is married, I will place her under the care-of .my H 6	Cecilia,

Cecilia, who, though exceedingly lively, is, nevertheless, very diScreet. She is greatly admired, yet makes no efforts to attrafl admiration; nor did she Spread lures for any other heart than mine. Surely no married man liad more reafon to be contented with his lot thari I have; and yet—

All this is true, yet I confeSs I was extremely Surprised to hear of Ashbury’s death.— I am the more concerned on Lady Frances’s account; for as she preferred him to all her other admjrers, I conclude that he was the only man she loved: great, therefore, must be her affliction upon the melancholy occasion.

My Cecilia, who is the tenderest of her Sex, weeps for Lady Frances more, perhaps, than she does for herSelf: and when I either attempt to chide her, or to Sooth her into better Spirits, she tells me that she knows what her dear friend must feel from her own SenSations ; adding, that were she in condition, she should be deprived of her SenSes. Foor girl,! she doats on' me : never, indeed, was there a man more beloved—adored, I may Say: for her Submishve and reSpedlr Sul attentions to me, are equal to her affedlionate ones.

Good girl! What an excellent fellow am I, D’Arcy, at finding out theSe condescending wives ? I do not believe they are to be matched in the three kingdoms.
I should be glad to know what Sort of a wife Lady Frances made : she was always thought to be uncommonly diScreet before marriage, and uncommonly good. Her behaviour to Lady Mary, my .wife, and Caroline, was truly noble : and she discovered, by the largeneSs of her generosity, the grandeur of her Soul.—But great qualities alone, in a wife, will not Satisfy me : I must have pleasing qualities alSo.—I like to love as well as to admire — better than merely to admire.

quer a concern which I could not but feel at the Severe shock I have Sustained : —but I must ever think of Mr. Ashbury’s death with regret, becauSe it was not in my power to render him as happy as he deServed to be.—I hope, however, that he was not diSpleaSed with me, as he So frequently and Solemnly declared in his last moments, that he was only affiided at his Separation from me, and that he wished only to live for my Sake. Had the Almighty granted him to my prayers, time, with my continual reflections upon his fine accomplishments, and ' his extreme affedlion for me, would, doubtleSs, have made me equally affectionate to him. It was not my fault, you 'know, my dear Bab, that I could not feel as he did.— I even fancied, when I was married to him, that I Sacrificed a great deal to compassion only; but I

have since learnt, that the tenderest love ought to accompany pity, to make a woman capable of doing the duty of a wife as she ought.—Yet, I hope, I am not to be looked upon in a criminal light, becauSe my feelings were not adequate to my wishes. To behave in a friendly generous manner, was certainly in my power; but to love with the ardor which poor Mr. Ashbury discovered, was not.—However, I would not, from what I have experienced, adviSe any woman to give her hand to a man till she feels herSelf SuSceptible of tenderneSs, as she may occasion a heavy disappointment to herSelf as well as to her hushand.—I have often heard that a virtuous woman will always love her hushand well enough, if she is an obedient wife; but I am , now ready to declare against that assertion. Had I thought Some time ago in

the way I do now, I might have Saved mySelf, and another perSon in the world, an infinite deal of diSquiet.—What is past cannot be recalled.—I adted wrong; but my motives were right. ' I must,' therefore, be resigned to my fate.
Lady Mary and Mrs, WalSingham have amply returned my friendship for them, by their behaviour, at this distreshng jundture. They have, both of them, earnestly invited me to stay with them till I am better reconciled to my lost. The latter, as she is in Berkley Square, has offered to be denied to all company, except a few particular friends of Mr. Wal-Singham’s, if I will be with her.

She is amiable beyond expression, infinitely more So than site ever appeared in my eyes. — She has all the allurements of grief, without any of the forbidding horrors of it.—She does not disfigure her face with her tears, nor wrinkle her Snowy forehead with a frown.—She does not call upon you to pity her by her complaints, but she, a thouland tirnes more forcibly, excites your compassion, by a kind of quiet Suffering ; by a ipensive Silence, which induces you to SuppoSe that what she feels mocks all the powers of utterance.'—How’^ unlike ihofe clamorous perSons is she, who, un-' der the preffure of their recent Sorrows, shehave in Such a manner, as 'to make ‘you Say you pity them -metely to get rid

of them!—Lady Frances, deSpising Such little artifices to procure compassion, confines her griefs within her own breast, and only diScovers them, now an^i then, by the tears which steal down her lovely cheeks. Sometimes, whe;n her tender heart is quite overcharged, she Seems to find relief from her sighs. Is it possible not to feel for Such an objedt as this ? The SenSations naturally arising at the fight of Such a woman, oppressed with her Sorrow, stimulates you to think of methods to alleviate at least, if not totally to remove them.
My Cecilia and I have Succeeded beyond our expedations. Lady Frances begins to lift up thofe eyes upon us^ -which, from the benignity, and Sweet-neSs in them, give every beholder joy. Her mouth is Sometimes dimpled with Smiles, and a graceful motion of her I 3	head,

» What a vast quantity of love is there in my Cecilia ! She may well fay, with the young Lady who was afked how she could be So fond of Such a number of people—“ I have a very capacious heart.” —Whether a married woman ought to be poffeffed of Such a heart—there’s the question.

Lady Frances Seems to me to be of a different turn; and she was, I imagine, never capable of loving two men in the world. Whether Ashbury was ever the man of her heart, I will not pretend to determine.
We are making preparations for Burton’s marriage. He is to take LouiSa home, who is to go by her mother’s name, that there may be no mistakes between her and any daughter he may have by this marriage. I am still to be her guardian.

Wal-singham behaves to his wife with the tenderest attention: he watches over her ;n her preSent condition with the liveliest affedion, and receives in return the strongest proofs of her Sincere love; and with a negligence reSulting from the pxcefs of good humour, he Seems to pverlook her foibles.—Even Cecilia cannot but appear to the diScerning eyes of her htishand with fome foibles — How happy must she be. So beloved. So attended to, and — if corrected — cor-rcDed in the gentlest manner imaginable, she is happy indeed. I never beheld So lively a pifture of content and joy.

Lady Frances is, in my opinion, much handSomer than when we took leave of her; or elfe the fatis/adlion which shone in her lovely eyes, on being informed of her young friend’s happineSs, gave her new graces. She thanked me, in Such elegant terms, for. the fecond happy alli-which I had occasioned in her family, that I should have been very stupid indeed, if I had not been delighted with her genteel behaviour. She Seems alSo to have almost conquered her afflidion; she looks, and talks with more chear-fulneSs than ever. She is extremely kind to Cecilia, who is clolely attached to her: to that attachment I, certainly, have no objedion : but, in general, I cannot highly approve of female friend-Jloips: having Seen the dear creatures quarrel about things of no more conSequence than straws.

We make a dreadful havock a-mong the women, Sometimes, D’Arcy, and steal into their hearts before they have time to make resistance.'r-I, therefore, fay again, that the attachment between my wife and her fair friend is a fortunate one.; the continuance may, reasonably, be expected, as it will not be, in all probability, weakened by competition.

IA M glad to hear, Bab, that yoii> have made your viSit to Mrs. Burton. Your behaviour was both polite and friendly. I am, alSo, pleaSed to find that our Sentiments are the Same with regard to her. She is extremely amiable; and as she deServes to be happy, she • will, I hope, he So with Mr. Burton.,
Mr. Burton is a genteel man—Fie is well-bred, and appears to be of a mild disposition. Caroline is all gentleneSs:	,

natures before they can lay the foundation for a quarrel. How exceedingly fortunate have theSe two young people been in having men for their hushands — Setting aside their Superiority in point of fortune — So very Suitable to them! Burton, it is true, was blameable for his imprudent connedtion with Mrs. Cary; yet I cannot rank him among thoSe abandoned libertines, who endeavour to Seduce every woman who comes in their way. There are few, indeed, of either Sex, who are not, at Some period of their lives, guilty of foibles ^ which they should have conquered at their first Setting out in the world; and I SuppoSe that Mr. Burton’s affedlion for his little daughter, made him both unwilling and afraid to diSmiSs her mother, being intimidated by her threatenings, while he was ivndcred unhappy by the

imperiouSneSs of her temper, when he talked of parting with her. — She at length, indeed, grew So inSolent, that if Walfingham had not appeared to assist his friend, there is no Saying with what conSequences So Scandalous an attachment might have been attended. You See plainly be had Spirit enough to recover his liberty when he was convinced of the ignominy of his Servitude. However, though I allow Mr. Burton to be one of thoSe men who are to be viewed in a pardonable light, yet in bow much higher a sight must his friend appear who has never committed his follies, and who,, with all the united graces of perSon and mind to render him desirable to So many women, has never, I am told, entered into any engagements which tend to make a man diffatisfied with his own condutst, and ridiculed by the worthy and Sensible

I look upon a man of Walsingham’s figure and talents, So formed to pleaSe the sight, and to charm the heart, a man So univerSally admired, to be still more deServing than other men leSs accomplished, and leSs engaging, for having had fortitude enough to resist all dangerous temptations.
WalSingham has brought his lively Cecilia to town, lively, notwithstanding her condition, as he intends to have her lie in with every kind of assistance within her reach. She has So earnestly intreated 7fj€ to be with her at the expedted time, that I find it difficult to refuSe her; and yet I have Several very strong reaSons to Support my refuSal. I have told her that Lady Mary is a niuch properer per-fon than I am, being 'as ignorant as herSelf. The wild thing laugh-s, and tells me that I ought to be better acquainted

quaintest with what must Sooner or later happen to me, as I shall, certainly, by a Seconst marriage, have occasion for my knowlestge.—She is a mast creature, anst will not believe that I shall not enter into Seconst engagements—I, continually, assure her, that I shall ever remain in ■ my preSent state — She only laughs at me, anst exclaims, “ Pshaw, Lasty Frances, this is mere talk, you will, un-stoubtestly, change your minst.”—In this manner does she trifle all stay long; but she has nothing to trouble her. WalSingham indulges her in every thing. Even Lasty Mary tells him that he will Spoil her girl — He Says it is impossible. Lasty Mary has pressed me exceedingly to be with her daughter, declaring, that she shall be poor company to her Son by herSelf. , But I do not chuSe to leave my own houSc' Caroline may come ^anst

She will not let me rest till I endeavour to prevail on Lady Frances to come and stay with her during her approaching confinement: she tells me that her mother and I shall be very dull by ourfelves; but she does not confider,djke a thoughtleSs child, as she is in her fah-cies, that she diScovers great imprudence by desiring to have So lovely a woman brought hoine to her hushand.
I always admired Lady Frances, and I am not Sure wKether I should be Safe with Such a woman continually near me with all her perfonal attradtions, all her powers of pleasing. — I have often, indeed, accuSed her of inSenSibility and indifference: she does not now appear to be either indifferent or infenfible. — Don’t mistake me, D’Arcy, I would, by no means, attempt to insinuate that this

She has no longer that shyneSs, that reServe, which distinn . guished her till she was married, and during the life of Ashbury; she is now freely converSible, and entertaining beyond expression. Can I look at Such a woman, can I listen to Such a woman with indifference? No.—Indeed, Ceci-^ lia, you never made a more imprudent request in your life.—And yet, when the dear girl comes, and Smiles tenderly in. my face, throws her Snowy arms rounds my neck, and tells me that she muji have, her dear, dear Lady Frances with her, VoL.

Lady Frances tells my wfife that she is quite weary of the importunities of the ■ men: but we are not obliged to believe every thing her Ladyship fays, though she may have a very great regard for truth.

YO U wonder I do not anSwer your letters ; but I am both out of Spirits, and out of temper.
Colonel Floyer torments me beyond expression; he not only teaSes me him-Self, but tells me that his friend Wal-fingham wishes him to fiicceed with me. How exceedingly provoking that is ? What can Walfingham have to do with. ^ regard to me; or what have I to do with the friendship Subsisting between them ? Why should be interest himSelf in my en-K 6	gage-
204 The AffectedTndifference,
gagements ? Surely Such a behaviour-must be reckoned extremely impertinent.—Should he have any other meaning, his attachment to his friend carries him a great way. He must have a violent affedion for Colonel Floyer, to wish me married to him. But I confefs I cannot think that I am obliged to Sacrifice my own happineSs to pleaSe Mr. WalSingham.—I should pay him a very high compliment indeed, by discovering So much condescension.
Men are, adlually, very unreashnable creatures. — How often am I obliged to repeat this assertion ? I shall begin, in a
^	't
short time, if I am thus haunted by them, to feel an aversion to the whole Sex. However, whether I intend to listen to a man again or not, I think it quite incumbent on me to let Mr. Walsingham know that I am exceedingly diSpleaSed
with
1

with his pretending to fay any thing to Floyer about me. .. •
On Second thoughts, I will not take any notice about this affair: it will be better, I believe, to let it paSs over in Silent contempt. Silence is Sometimes more cutting than the sharpest expressions.

I Have, indisputably, offended Lady Frances in Some shape; and I cannot possibly tell .what part of my behaviour to her has kindled her reSent-ment against me.

However, as I really believe that she would not be capricioussy offended, and am ready to conclude that she can urge Some plausible reaSons—though not un-' anSwerable ones, for her contemptuous. coolneSs, I will take the first opportuisity to assc her in what manner I have deserved it.

POOR Walsingham is very ill. Lady Mary is exceedingly alarmed about him. Happily, Mrs. Walsingham does not yet SuSpeft his being out of order, and he takes the greatest care to prevent her feeling a moment’s uneasi-neSs.

Lady Mary hurried up, calling the Servants all the way. I followed her.
When we came into the room, Wal-Singham Seemed fallen to the ground, as if in a fainting fit, with his head on Mrs. WalSingham’s bed, who was ringing her bell, excessively frightened.
On our entering die room. Walling-ham opened his eyes, and his Servant lifted him into his chair. He leant back, and was incapable of Speaking for Some time.
I do not know whether I was ever more terrified in my life. I thought he was aDually dying. I held a bottle of Salts to his noSe, as Lady Mary was busied

When he began to revive a little, his Servants carried him into his own apartment, and put him to bed : he now lies' in a fever, but the physicians lay that there is no danger.

Cecilia is'-no more. She ex*-
pired yesterday in the arms of him who occasioned her death. She adlually died a martyr to her tenderneSs. Never was there a woman who more doatingly loved hershushand; never was there a hushand more kind, more tender to his wife—He looks the picture of Sorrow.

Lady Mary laments her lost child, as if she had not another. In vain I remind her of her Caroline: In vain I put the infant Cecilia into her arms—;-The grandmother is forgot in the mother, and she remembers only what' has been taken from her.	.	^	^	-
From the distressed hushand, and from the afssitsted mother, I turn to my poor young friend, who Smiles, and looks lovely even in death : she had no wish to live but for her Walsingham : she was only unwilling to die, becauSe she could not bear the thoughts of being Separated from him.	' "
Just before she fetched her last sigh, she thanked him for his unnumbered kindnesses to her, and declared that the Separation from So excellent a hushand was far more painful to her than the stroke of death. She begged him not L 4	to

to grieve for her, as she had the conSo-lation not to Survive him, an event she had ever dreaded more than any thing. Then, warmly recommending both her mother and her daughter to his affectionate attention, she breathed her last sigh on his boSom.
Poor young creature ! how. Soon is she Snatched from us ! from a w-orld in which, she enjoyed more felicity than many ' women do—Yet her death shay, perhaps, be reckoned a fortunate event for her, as she would, probably, have found' her hushand’s love on the decline, had
she lived much longer.,--What do I
Say?—No—Walsingham, Surely, never would have ceaSed to love her. I am perSuaded that if he had felt any diminution of his tenderneSs, he would have, most carefully, concealed it from her.—

I could not help Saying—though I believe. I Spoke too hastily—that they, should not then marry at all, and that her opinion-of the men gave no strength-to-, her arguments in favour of Floyer.

I am Surprised to find that Lady Mary bears the loSs of her daughter So well : but she is, I believe, one of thoSe women who make no shew of their grief, yet feel it with great violence : with more violence, perhaps, than the people who loudly complain of their Sufferings, and weep from morning to night. Many perSons oppressed with their Sorrows, are considerably relieved by giving a free vent to their tears and their lamentations. Lady Mary’s behaviour is Sufficient to strengthen the above affer-tk)ns. She ieems to have a flow, nervous fever.

, The Burtons brought MiSs Caryi-vyith them; she flew to her dear guardiaii:^as she calls him—He tqpk her up in his lap, though I think she is rather too old - to be fondled in that manner: but thje girl Seemed wonderfully delighted with, his attention to her, and expressed the greatest affedlion for him in return. Perhaps he may bring this girl to be a Second Cecilia. She is very pretty, she has a remarkably - quick understanding, and much vivacity: she pays the utmost regard, however, to every thing WalSingham Says to her: and diScovers, -by every look and adtion, an implicit * obedience ^ to him: she Seems far more inclined to obey him than her father, who, though extremely fond of his .daughter, does not shew his fondneSs in .the engaging manner peculiar to Wal-singham..

344 The Affected Indifference.
Mifs Cary behaves alSo with great re-Spetst to Mrs. Burton, and more frequently calls her Madam than Mama: yet Caroline Seems to be better pleaSed with the latter than the former appellation, and really appears very much diverted with liouiSa, who has, indeed, a number of entertaining ways, and knows perfedtly well how to make her ‘ court to thofe with whom she wishes to ingratiate her-Self. She is, adlually, an amusing girl; but she put me exceedingly out of countenance, yesterday.—She is, or pretends to be, very fond of me, and had been coaxing me to .let her pull off my brace- ' let, that she might look at the pidture.
I consented, merely to get rid of her, as she had teaSed me a good deal about it.
She ran with it diredUy to Walsing-ham. It was your pidlure, my dear.—
“ Here is a pretty lady, Mr. WalSmg-
y ham.
The Affected Indifference. 245.
“ ham,” Said she, “I must kifs her; won’t “ you kiSs her, as she is So very pretty ?”
He Snatched the bracelet out of her hand, and casting the most reSpedtful glance at me, turned the inside of the pearls which had tqiiched my arm, and put it to his lips.
My face was, instantly, in a glow. I could not help it. Why did he behave So —But it was the child’s fault. Children and fools are always faying or doing Some improprieties.—In short, I was So much diSconcerted by the singularity of Walsingham’s behaviour, that I could Scarce lift up my eyes to him all day.
Yours most affedlionately, FRANCES ASHBURY.

I Ought to have been in London ere now, but I can never quit this place while Lady Frances remains in it. She talks of going to Ashbury Park; yet having been strongly in treated to stay here by every body—except me—she has hitherto yielded to their wishes.
Had

Had I dared to flatter mySelf that she would have granted ray request, I too, might, possibly, have ventured to ask her—but I am So fearful of offending, that I cannot Speak when I really should not be silent.—There is, however, fb , great a change in her carriage, that were I not the most timid fellow in the kino--
O
dom—rendered timid only from my extreme veneration for her (if you will bear that expreshon from a man So passionately in love as I am) I should certainly construe it into the greatest encouragement. Not that there is the (lightest impropriety in her behaviour: she is not in the least forward ^ not even free. She is always difcreet, always charming; I only mean,’ that her behaviour has been different since Ashbury’s death. There is no longer a

chilling coldneSs in her manner; she is no longer forbiddingly reServed. I fee ' nothing of that haiightinefs in her, which prevented me, before her marriage, from entertaining the most distant hopes oS fuccefs as a lover. But it is too Soon for me to think of making my addresses, to her, tas my w'ife has been dead So short a time; and I am Sure that she will look upon any addresses from me at prefent as too precipitate. We must therefore Separate; that is, \ imagine vio. must Separate. However, I hope I may be permitted to visit her—I hope that favour will not- be denied me. As the hushand of her relation—had we never been So well acquainted—I cannot, certainly, be excuSed from paying my compliments to her, should I have no inclination to pay them.---She wijl Soon be

at Ashbury Park : What must I ‘ do then ? I must not preSurne to go thither without an invitation : and I am afraH I shall not be particularly invited by. her.—I must learn to live without her.
If I have no hopes of living always with her, I had better never See her again. I shall aft more prudently by weaning my-Self, at once, from So enchanting a companion. But Such an undertaking is, I fear, too much for me.
LouiSa Cary is very fond of this charming woman: Who, indeed, is not ? She honours my little ward by taking a great deal of notice of her— For my part, I declare that I am half , mad to Snatch thofe amiable caresses from ' " the child which she liberally bestows ,
. upon her.-----Am I not far gone ?
Certainly I am—Oh! D’ Arcy, what

• I did not decline being 'off the party merely on WalSingham’s account — I ' . had intended, you know, to take a journey into Staffordjhire., and only staid in tov/n to oblige Lady Mary, who has' now brought herSelf to be quite resigned ' to the loSs of her daughter.
WalSingham appeared to be revived a little before I talked of coming away; but as Soon as my departure was fixed, his dejedlion returned, and he Seemed to ^ be either buried in thought, or abSent: he frequently committed strange mistakes, as.if from a total want of attention to any thing; though nobody is more observing. He' was indeed So penetrating about my behaviour, -that I was obliged to keep a stridl: guard upon it: <a guard which became troubleSome- to>me. Not
that

that I had any particular reaSon to be So extremely circumSpedt; but as he watched my looks more narrowly than thoSe of the rest of the company, I could not help being embarrassed by them.
When I had taken leave of Mr. and Mrs. Burton, and MiSs Cary, Walsing-ham advanced, with his eyes thrown .	, down.
After having fixed them on me till I was quite difconcerted, he wished me a pleafant journey. Then, raising them again, added, with a Sigh, “ May Ishe ' permitted, madam, to have the honour of ,waiting on you at Ashbury Park .
That question confuSed me—I felt mySelf look filly—Could there be any impropriety in a visit from the hushand of my aunt’s daughter?—Certainly not: and yet—to be Sure I never behaved in B 2	sh
4 The Affected Indifference.
So ridiculous a manner—^I made him no anSwer: I only made him a curtSy,
1 which he might have, undoubtedly, converted into a permission, if he had been So inclined.
I donst know any thing So vexatious as a propensity to be diSconcerted. Lately I have been frequently diSconcerted; « but I was not always So foolish. One gets unaccountable habits Sometimes, nobody knows how—But I have got a still worSe habit than that which I have mentioned. I am grown ill tempered; and Tpeak So fretfully to my people, and am So peevish, and So diSagreeable to mySelf, as well as to every body elSe, that I care ' not what becomes of me.—I condemn mySelf Severely for my fretfulneSs, for Suffering it to triumph over my natural disposition, which was never reckoned intolerable, I believe, before.

agreeable to mySelf, and will render me So to every body elfe. The houSe, the situation, the gardens, the park are^ all fine, but they fill my mind with a train of melancholy ideas; and they bring back past Scenes which were never pleasing, which I now ‘only remember with anxiety and regret.—How much happier should I have been, had I never had a right to this place, had I never been entitled to the name of Ashbury ? But what is past cannot be recalled : I 'will, therefore, endeavour to think no more of it.
I am Surrounded with company—I am praiSed, flattered, courted, and admired; yet I am a poor, joyleSs, tasteleSs creature. Never am I So pleaSed as when at a distance from every body; never So happy as when alone. — By no means, however, am I happy even when alone.
I could

I could not well avoid coming hither; but I have, a thouSand times, wished mySelf at the place from whence I came. There Was Something inexpressibly agree-'able in the Society of Lady Mary’s- fa-mily; and though you may, perhaps, think that my hours were melancholy ones after the death of Mrs. WalSing-. ham, L do assure you* I did not find them unpleasingly So — BeSides, I was there employedhn comforting the asslic- ' ted, in Soothing the unhappy, in dissipating the gloomy thoughts of the distress, and turning iheir attention to ehearful fubje(5ls. I was there of Some uSe, but here I am quite good for nothing; a poor idle wretch! Set up merely for a crowd to stare at, and to praiSe or blame at the command of caprice.

rally ariSe in my mind, as I am at present Situated. I am quite a new being in this part of the country; and as the widow of Mr. Ashbury, as the hiistreSs of this park, people from every quarter pour in upon me; not So much out of reSpe<st to the memory of the deceafed, or out of attention to the living, but entirely out of curiosity. —r “ What fort of a perSon has she ? How does she look What does she Say ? Is she gay or Serious, affable or proud, silent or talkative ?” TheSe questions have, I dare fay, been continually repeated among my new neighbours ever since my arrival. —However, there are, certainly, a great number of agreeable people within my reach, and I might receive no Small pleasure from their company in any other Situation. The truth is, I believe, I have only mySelf to blame, for not re-

' I am not in a humour to be pleafed with any living creature; • with any thing about me.—My eyes and rny ears are perpetually offended* I never could / be amuSed with your large assemblies : I was ever of opinion that there is more conversation — though perhaps not So much talking—in a little circle than a great one.—And yet a Solitary life is extremely unpleaSant; hardly justifiable indeed—I am thoroughly convinced that hundreds have had their intelleds disturbed, their tempers Soured by plung-* ing themSelves into retirement, and giv-ing up all commerce with the world’...

Your Society, my dear MiSs Herbert, and the conversation of two or three more as agreeable and entertaining as .yourfelf, -would be Sufficient to make my life glide away in the most desirable manner.
How often have I wished thatjy^?:^ and I could be nearer to each other for a longer time than we have lately enjoyed ourSelves together! But since there is a leSs probability than ever of our enjoying each other’s company, as you ■will, undoubtedly, be married; and as 'we may be still at a farther distance from • ^ each other, I feel a strong desire to re- ■ turn to Lady Mary, or to go to Mrs. Burton — I should, at Mr. Burton’s, be in your neighbourhood.

Could I, my dear friend—tell me,-Bab; could I with any propriety go again into the houSe with WalSingham, So peculiarly situated as I was?

was deposited like a discontented Spirit. And who are WE ? you Say.—Why, Lady Frances and your melancholy friend. That lovely woman is gone to Ashbury Park, and I did not take leave of her in the manner I wished. I did not dare to utter the fiightest part of what my foul felt upon the very diSagreeable occasion.—How cruel was the Separation !
Haverford, who accompanied her at the request of his Lady, tells me that she is, at preSent, Surrounded with a new train of admirers. He does not give . me this infonhation imagining that I-am in the least concerned in it, for I never trusted Such a thoughtleSs, unfeeling mortal with my Sentiments relating to this charming woman. Besides, he ^cs not like her; he writes only what passes, by way of news, pourtuer le terns.
He tells me that Lord Berners, whoSe ; ^	estate

estate joins to Ashbury Park, appears to be captivated with Lady Frances, and stands as fair a chance to carry the day as any man in her fuite.—Had he known how this piece of intelligence would have tortured rrie. Surely he would have Sup- -pressed it.
How can I prevent her receiving the addresses of her admirers} How can I,
, till a decent time is elapSed Since the death of my Cecilia, mention my paS-fion for her? I shewed, indeed, what I felt by every sign in my power, without deviating from my reSpeft for Lady • Frances, Rnd without affronting her delicacy ; but if she neither understood me,

are not gone too far, I may, perhaps, make a diversion, at least; and this is the only hope left for me. — Burton, stis true, affures me, that she will come to Datchet when she leaves Ashbury Park, and has invited me to be ready to meet her: but that invitation comes too late. The mifchief is, certainly, already done, or it will be done before that time : by that time she will be either married, or honourably engaged. — I must, therefore, go down to'Stafford- -shire, and See how the land lies. But SuppoSe my apprehensions should be groundless, why should I flatter mySelf that she will ever be mine: she, who,
' when I had the fairest opportunity to 1 crown my wishes, drove me to deSpair by the most chilling, the most cutting indifference ? Why should I imagine that she will ever honour me with her hand ?

Afhbury Park.
I A M just returned from the county assembly, to which I was dragged quite against my inclination: and yet I think it is of Service to us to change the Scene Sometimes.
At the assembly I was furprifed in Such a manner, that my Spirits were almost overpowered; my Spirits, indeed, are , not half So good as they ufed to be. I wonder what ails me.—My frequent ssut-
terings

terings become extremely diSagreeable: they make me fit for nothing.—
WalSingham appeared, on a Sudden—• Why should I be So affefted at the fight of him ? — I never was So much disordered in my life: I believe I found myfelf So disordered becauSe I had, after having been repeatedly intreated to dance with Lord Berners, given him my conSent. He' had just taken my hand when WalSingham appeared.
To Say I was astonished at his unex- ^ pefted appearance, is to expreSs, very imperfedlly, my SenSations upon the occasion — I am Sure I looked like a fool. My hand dropped from Lord Berners’s:
I opened my eyes as if I had never Seen * a man before • and then cast them down again, wishing to shrink into myfelf^ to hide a confusion, for which I could not account, and which was increaSed

With what a grace did he approach to pay me the most reSpecstful cornpli-ments! ThoSe compliments were delivered in the ifiost elegant language, and uttered with a voice So full of rnelody, that they almost stole away my fenfes. I Saw, however, ^ that every perSon in the room drew back on his advancing, as if he alone merited the attention of the whole assembly.
When ,ths first civilities were over, he ashed me, with the most befeeching looks and accents, if I was. engaged for the countiy dances.
I stammered out. Yes : but I Scarce knew in what manner I pronounced that monoSyllable, as all eyes were fixed on ' me.

“ I was once favoured with that lovely hand,” Said he, “ for a whole happy evening. “ How inexpressibly unfortunate am I,” added he with a-sigh, “ in having arrived too late!”
Shall I confeSs the honest tmth, Bab ? I was nearly as Sorry as he himSelf was. However, there was no remedy.—To make the matter worSe, I had not danced since the death of Mr. Ashbury, and should not then have conSented, had I not been teafed beyond all enduring by Lord Berners, who is, really, a well-bred man, and has nothing of the coxcomb ^ in him.
Seeing Walfingham fit down, as Soon as the dances began, without having alked any other Lady for her hand, and ' ' look dejedted and disappointed, I actually felt for him.—I could not help it. I am grown excessively filly. Yet why
should
20 The Affected Indifference,
should I think it a weakneSs to be concerned about Such a man as WalSing-ham; a man whom all women admire - Whom all women, I may add, love ?
A man-without'a fault.?—But did not I behave too particularly, by fitting down after the Second danceI could not but be SuppoSed deSirous of hearing Some- ■ thing about Lady Mary, Mrs. Burton, ^c, &c.
Luckily, I had told Lord Berners at first, that I would dance but one dance, and as I conSented to go down -another with him,, he could not, reaSoa-ably, complain of my behaviour; and, indeed, my Lord, who is perfedly polite, after having conduced me to my feat— gueshng, I imagine, that WalSingham had Something to Say to me, as he came and Sat shy me~left me for Some time.

Walsingham, whoSe chearfulneSs returned, on Lord Berners’s departure from us, entertained me with a thouSand a--musing things, till his Lordship joined us, and even then still kept up the conversation with uncommon Spirit.
When the affembly broke up, Wal-Singham almost overSet Lord Berners in Seizing my hand to lead me to the coach. —As there was a corner in it to Ipare—• Lord Haverford not being of our party — My Lady or I — I really cannot remember who was the perfon—ashed him to accept of it.—He wanted no pressing; and we left him at Sir James Caldwall’s, whoSe houfe is about half a mile on the other fide of Ashbury Park.

He anSwered in the affirmative, and repeated his wishes to See me.
I went down, therefore, to Caldwall-houSe, and made all the necessary enquiries about my Lady Widow, before I made my appearance any where. I then accompanied Sir James to the county assembly, having heard that she was to . be there.
She was there indeed: but what a Sweet confusion did the amiable creature discover at the sight,of me !
My happy rival was tcloSe to her when I entered the room: he Took her hand, on my advancing; but eitlier from the SuddenneSs of my appearance, or the precipitation of my approach ■— for my ea-

The charming creature appeared to be not leSs Satisfied v/ith me, than I was v/ith her, though she was inconceivably disconcerted.—However, her embaraff-ment was, to me, the most favourable Symptom imaginable.
Her admiring lord, to do him justice, was well-bred, and discovered no Suspicions : but I find Some riling, at this moment, in my breast.

Between you and I, D’Arcy, I did not think I had been Such a coxcomb : but this love is the very devil, and turns our dispositions topSyturvy. Yet, wdiy .' did she ash me to let her Set me down!— civility—mere civility—nothing more.— When a fine woman is only decently polite to a man, he is very apt—too apt— under the dominion of vanity—to construe her common civilities into particular attentions.—I am tlien, indiSputably, become a dov/nright blockhead ; I have most egregioussy duped myfelf.	^

In fafb, it is imposhble but to be mistaken. in. them.—- What a high opinion had I of Lady Frances, from my first acquaintance with her ; and even, while I accuSed her of indifference and inSen-sibility, I thought her condiKst irreproachable. There was a propriety in her behaviour which I obServcd in few _ women, and which raiSed her, every moment, higher in fny esteem ; but upon my marrying a relation of hers, and becoming, unavoidably, intimate with her, I discovered charms unleen before ;■ new charms, new graces, accompanied with a large train of virtues, which almost rendered her, in my eyes, an objedt of adoration. I was still farther transported with her, when I found, upon my wife’s death, that she appeared to take more than a relation’s part in my affliction ; that she endeavoured, by a thou-

Stimulated by So animating, So flattering a carriage, I was induced to hope that I might, in time, gain upon her, and prevail on her to listen to the passion I had long, felt for her; to listen to it, and to return it. The moment decency would permit me to follow the impulse of my inclination,
I hurried down to this place to be near-her. The charming flutter into which she was thrown on my Sudden appear- . ance, the particular attention which she paid me, and the pleaSure with which she, apparently, received my assiduities, gave me the strongest encouragement to imagine that I might, at a proper time, venture, in a proper manner, to inform / her of the tender Sentiments v/hich I had

IWAS too hasty. I have been wrong —Lady Frances is still the dear,, amiable creature I ever believed her to • be. She was, unavoidably, obliged by an. unlucky concurrence of circumstances,^ of which I was ignorant, to a6t in the; manner I mentioned in my last letter.

I returned to the charge; and telling the Servant that I knew Lady Frances was at home, added, that I would on no account presume to preSs upon • her when she was otherwise engaged; but that I should efceein mySelf particularly happy to be admitted to See her,, whenever it was most convenient to her to favour me with Such an indulgence.
The Servant, who had ever treated me with the highest refpedt, desired me to walk into the parlour while he went up to his Lady.
He staid a considerable time. He then came down, and in the most Submissive manner, having begged my pardon for making me wait, informed me
that

She looked Sweetly embarraffed—yet I Soon found that she rather affcDed to tmat the conclusion of it as a piece of unmeaning gallantry, than to take it ferioussy, as it was intended ; and she < continued, artfully enough, to evade any furthei* mention of herfelf, by expressing her Surprise at Lord Haverford’s conduD, which was, she laid, the more indefensible, as he had feduced the daughter of a clergyman, a man fo justly, So universally esteemed ; a man, who had given his children So virtuous an education : and that he had adted fo indiscreetly when my Lady happened to be with him, who could not be well kept ignorant of his behaviour.
“ It was in order to prevent Lady Haverford’s unhappiaeSs, ” replied I, “ that I

She lifted up her charming eyes with ‘ an approving Smile—“ I am exceedingly obliged to you, sir: it is a great pity that Lady Haverford cannot know how much you have Suffered for her.

From the Same to the Same.
I Was animated with the livesiest the most encouraging hopes, when I finished my last letter. I could not be Such a puppy as to make a mistake :■ thoSe hopes, however, are all. crushed, all vanished in fimo.
I will relate, minutely, all. that passed' between us.
I have already informed you of every, part of this engaging woman’s condutst from the first commencement of our acquaintance: I have acquainted you , with the prodigious change which appeared in my favour. Flattered by that

change, I fondly imagined ,th at I might be attended to as Soon as it v/as decent for me to Speak upon a Subjedl which had So long -been nearest to my heart.
I leized,^ as I thought, the luckiest opportunity conceivable to bring, about the completion of my wishes.
On my calling, this morning, at Ashbury Park, the Servant told me that the ladies were in the temple in the grove, and did not even offer to go be-’ fore me to announce my arrival.—I imagined, indeed, tfiat he might have been	;
guilty of a piece of negligence, and. that his Lady might be a little dilpleafed with me for breaking' in abruptly upon her retired hours.—However, I hastened to the'temple, without considering whether my preSence would be difagree-	\
able to her or, not; I thought of nothing	|

but of the pleaSure of flying to her without any interruption.
She w^as Sitting in an elegant undreSs, writing at a table. Lady Haverford was netting lace, and Icon afterwards, riSing up, went into the garden.
I took her 'feat near Lady Frances, who, instead of appearing in the least reServed, laid down her pen, and with an alluring glow over her face, put her papers into my hand. I do* not know. Said she, whether you approve of a woman’s employing herSelf in ' this manner or not, Mr. Walfingham; but as I do not think I am quite mistreSs of the Italian language, I fancied, that by tranflating Some pieces from different authors, and studying their different styles, 1 might quicken my progreSs in its*
' 1
I was
66 The Affected Indifference.
I was So much transported v/ith the judgment which she discovered upon this occasion, wdth the modest diffidence with which she Solicited my approbation, and with the flattering confidence she repoSed in me, that I am prctty Sure every thought in my mind was discernible in my countenance,
Unab'e to Support my tender looks, she threw down her lovely eyes, while I delivered the Sentiments which her ad-dreSs and behaviour had excited. I could not indeed help bestowing the warmest encomiums on her employment, and on the charming freedom and cafe wsith which she communicated it to me.
Her embarraffment increafed while I Spoke ; but it was a Sort of embarraffment which rendered her still more beautiful than she was before; and it, at the Same time, prompted me to hope,
that
The Affected Indifference. ^7
that I might be listened to upon a more interesting Subjedl.
Encouraged to proceed, I ventured, after a little hesitation, naturally arising from the timidity with which true love is always attended, to tell her all that my doatSng heart had long felt for her.
She heard me, with her eyes fixed upon the paper which lay before her : and when I ceafed to Speak, she still continued Silent.
Gently taking hold of her hand, I intreated her to inform me, if she was too much offended with what I had presumed to mention, as not to think me w^orthy of a reply.
Raising up her eyes, at length, with an apparent relu<5lance, she Said, “ I cannot be offended with you, Mr. Walsing-bam; but X desire to hear no more upon.
this

this Subjedt. I wish you had not men* tioned it at all.
“ Since you are not offended with me then, my amiable Lady Frances,” Said I,
‘‘ give me leave to expreSs my extreme concern at your wishing me to have been silent upon a Subjedt which has, for a long time, engrossed my attention; give me leave, alSo, to hope, that you will change your opinion, as you will, by refusing to hear me upon that Subjedt, entirely destroy my peace.—From the first moment I beheld you, madam, I was charmed with the lovelinefs of your perSon, the strength of your understanding, and the elegance of your manners; ^ but, upon a nearer acquaintance, I became still more attached to you, becauSe I discovered innumerable fine qualities and accomplishments.
With
The Affected Indifference, 69
With Such strong prepossessions in my favour, perhaps you will Say, “ Why did you conceal them from me? — Mere curiosity might have urged you to See howl should be affedted by them. ” .
My anSwer is, “ You kept me at So great ' a distance by your indifference, and by the coolneSs of your behaviour, that P concluded it would be impossible for me to prevail on you to give me that V hand which, I found afterwards, you had ' reServed for the happy Ashbury; happy, ' madam, even in death, as he had been Se-ledted from his Sex by you. TheSe considerations alone, I call heaven to be my witneSs, determined me nev’^er to declare the ardent passion I felt for you—Despairing, at length, of having it returned, I endeavoured to diredl my attention to' MiSs Sommers, who gave me all modest encouragement: to believe, that

she wished I would particularly distin* guish her: but I never should have distinguished her., had I not been certain that you was entirely lost to me.—Upon my marriage with that amiable woman, whom I endeavoured to make happy, you treated me like a man who was be-^come your relation ; and on the deceafe of your Mr. Ashbury and of my Cecilia, kindly shewed So much SweetneSs of disposition in listening to my conSola-tions, and in offering yours in return, that I began to fancy I was really not So odious to you as I at first imagined my-Self to be. I even went farther, I madly prefumed to SuppoSe, that when you had 'got over the loSs of Mr. Ashbury, and when I could decently open my lips, I might be permitted to plead -for my happineSs, which depends entirely upon you: it is in your power, with.a
single
/
The Affected Indifference. 71
Single word, to make me completely happy, or completely wretched. —If I have made my appearance too abruptly, if I have taken an improper time to unboSom mySelf freely to you, if you cannot yet bring yourSelf to give me a favourable anSwer, I will endeavour to wait with patience for a more fortunate moment, though I am affured that if you could be made Sensible of the acuteneSs of my Sufferings from Such a delay, you would, from the natural benevolence of your temper, be whiling to shorten the hours of my probation.”
She appeared to be exceedingly dll-concerted during the above Speech: she was, adtually, fluttered to Such a degree, that I concluded she could not be un- > moved at what I had Said—I was, indeed, rendered defirous, by her embarraff-N - ment, to Spare her blushes, and to give

her a reafonatle time to trame a reply ; though I was half distraded all the', while to be certain of my felicity, by hearing her lovely lips pronounce her conSent, which I So ardently wished to obtain. — But she Soon convinced me of the error I had committed, in buoying mySelf up with flattering hopes, by Saying, though with Seemingly great emo-tion, “ Indeed, Mr. WalSingham, I must not hear you talk in this manner .;
I cannot listen to you, indeed I cannot.’*
“ Not just now, perhaps, my excellent Lady Frances,*’ Said I, eagerly - Seizing her hand, which she had withdrawn, and still imputing her coyneSs' to a delicacy which rendered her a thousand times more desirable ; “ not now. Lady Frances, becauSe I may have interrupted you at a time when you chuSe

-The man, madam, who prefers his own happineSs to the happinefs of her with whom he wishes to Spend the remainder of his life, must give but a very indifferent idea of his concern for her
i
peace. ”
“ Your Sentiments are very generous, fir,** replied she, still more diScompoSed:
“ I will even confeSs that I am pained, becauSe I cannot return the anSwer you wish to receive from me, the anfwer you certainly deferve. But it is totally out of , my power to return that anfwer; and I should groSsly injure you by a trifling behaviour—I must, therefore, tell you VoL. II.	E	plainly,

plainly, at once, that I will never marry again: I will as plainly add, that were I, 'diSpofed to change my situation, I never can become the 'wife of Mr. Walsing-ham. ”
. “ And why not ?” cried I, astonished, and shocked beyond expression— “ For God’s Sake tell me what I have done, to be for ever excluded from the only hap-pinefs left for me in this world ! — Rested:, madam, let me conjure you, Seri-dufiy rested, a Single moment; recall your cruel words, and do not drive me to deSpair.”
“ I am determined,” Said she, quite recovered from the embarrassment under which she before laboured. — “I am re-folved never to retrad wiiat I have Said •i—I am Sorry I am obliged to be So peremptory, but I can never be the wife of Mr. Walsingham. I^et me, there-

Sufficiently convinced me that her resolution was not to be shaken. And yet the former part of her behaviour was So widely different from the latter.

OH ! Bab, my dear Bab, what a fate is mine? WalSingham, the amiable WalSingham, has made an offer of his hand : an offer I dare not accept; an offer, of which the refuSal has half di-stradled me.—However, as I was but too Sensible I could not, without diS-. covering the most unpardonable inattention to delicacy; encourage his addresses, circumstanced as I am, I had fortitude enough to rejedl them : though I Sometimes wonder how I could bring
mySelf
The Affected Indifference. 79
mySelf to adb in a manner So very opposite to the didtates of my heart, as 1 have been, from my first acquaintance with WalSingham’s virtues, strongly prepossessed in his favour.
You are furpriSed, I imagine, to hear me make this frank confession; but I am very ready to own that he is the only -man whom I ever did, whom I ever can love; and I, the more readily, permit mySelf to make this avowal of the preference I give him, in order to make mySelf Some amends for the cruel violence I have done my heart by Such a Sacrifice to—what shall I call it ?
Oh ! Bab; I can no longer conceal from you the every Secret of my full heart.—I mujt tell my faithful friend, that WalSingham is entirely master of all the movements of that heart.—Yet, conscious of having preferred him to Mr.

Ashbury, at the very time I was married to him ; and conScious of Ashbury’s uneasineSs on his account, I neither can, nor ought, I think, to be the wife of » Walfingham, Supposing I could conquer my other Scruples, with regard to the indelicacy of a Second marriage.—I have, indeed, been long of opinion that no woman should confent to take a Second hushand, unleSs she is particularly situated, and can advance very powerful reasons for her condudt. Now as I am not in a Situation to make that condudt defensible, I declined an offer from Mr. Wal-singham, which would have been accepted, at our first acquaintance, in a manner Sufficient to diScover the just SenSe I had of his merit, hadshe not informed me that He was prevented from the communication of his feelings on my account, to the cool-nefs, the indifference of my behaviour

to him; yet why should he who never gave me the least reafon to imagine that he was in love with me, or that he ever entertained the most distant idea of ad-dreshng me, attribiue his disappointment to me^ If he is disappointed, he must blame no body but himSelf.—He has certainly destroyed my peace.—woman of real virtue, a woman even of common modesty will not—ought not to encourage a man who pays her no partk Gular attention. Do not thofe women who endeavour to draw the eyes of every man who comes in their way, and to at-tradl his notice, leffeir themSelves in the eyes of all prudent people, and shew a very considerable difregard for their reputation? Besides, could I ever have imagined that Walfingham would have endured Such a woman ? He has complimented me highly upon my virtues, as E 5.	he

he calls them; would he have So complimented me, had I been a downright flirt ? Certainly not. If I have lost hiin, then, only by a diScreet reServe becom-- ing my Sex, and rank in life, I must bear it. I must Submit to what cannot be remedied, and strive to think no more about him as a lover; I must think of him only as -a friend : but as a friend, as the hushand of my Cecilia, I may.

Satisfactions, at this moment! They will lessen, I am afraid, every day. I am unfortunate,' Bab, but do not impute a studied indifference to me. No, my friend, I could not, certainly, take pains to‘behave with coolneSs to the man of whom I So much approved ; but when I Saw his whole attention fixed upon another, I should have been very impertinent, indelicate indeed, to a degree, by ' throwing mySelf in shis. way.—I shoulel have made mySelf, by Such a furward 'proceeding, cheap indeed : and he would have deSpiSed me—justly defpiSed me.
In the midst of my vexation and diSap-"pointment, I feel no Small comfort by considering that I have not rendered my- -Self an objeft of contempt to the man whom I So highly esteem. His contempt ' would be truly inSupportable.- '

How great ,will be the impropriety of my behaviour, if I give my hand to .the man of whom my hushand was-jealous ? of whom he had, I know, reafon to be jealous. ' Do not mistake me, Bab; nor start, on a Supposition that I ever gave Mr. Wal-Singham the most distant encouragement during Mr. Ashbury’s life.—Walfing-ham, himSelf, will vindicate me under Such * an accuSation; but is not a woman, who is conScious of having liked a man better than her hushand, in Some shape culpable, if not adtually criminal ?

If a woman gives encourage-,ment to any man after she is married, she is, stis true, guilty of a capital crime: but Jhe who Secretly entertains wishes which revolt against her affeftion and duty to her hushand, cannot, in my opinion,, be quite exculpated'.—And can I lay my hand upon my heart, and Say, I never harboured fuch wishes ^—^No— I can only then make atonement for. th.

about this lovely woman, impelled me ^ to order my chaife to drive to this part of the country; in which if I have not met with the relief which change of place generally affords to a mind rustled by diSappointmet — at least, I am, acci- . dentally, thrown in the way of a very amiable woman, to whom, I flatter my-Self, I may be Serviceable. There is Some conSolation arising from our endeavours to, make other people happy, though we are not blessed with the means to enSure our own felicity.
Here is, in this neighbourhood, a Mrs. Leland whom her hushand left entangled in a law-Suit, and So much distressed in her circumstances, that though a woman of no contemptible family, and well-educated, she found herSelf under a necessity of offering herSelf as a Servant for a Subsistence. A few days ago she '	' offered
The Affected Indifference. 93
offered herSelf to Mrs.. Burton whole fervant is going to be married.
/ Mrs. Burton mentioned Mrs. Leland in Such high terms to her hushand and to me, that we wanted to See her, and desired Mrs. Burton to let u§ be preSent when she came again. She readily complied with our wishes.
We were in her dressing-room when Mrs. Leland entered it.
Though I had heard So much of her,
I was quite struck with her appearance— With a very fine, and desirable perSon, she had a modest dignity in her carriage, and appeared So Submissive to the will of the mistreSs whom she was going to Serve, while she looked, at the Same time, formed to command, that I con-feSs I was pained to fee her in So humiliating a Situation, and I could not help flying to reach a Chair for her.
.Mr. •
94 The Affected Indifference.'
Mrs. Burton intreated her to sit: she went immediately to a chair at the bottom of the room.
Mrs. Burton’s condescension to a woman of Mrs. Leland’s appearance was, at once. So kind, and So judicious, and her affability gave her So many new graces, that I never Saw her in So engaging a light before. She appeared So compassionate, and to wish So earnestly— her looks Sufficiently discovered the movements of her excellent heart upon the occafion-—to be uSeful to Mrs. 'Le-land, that if she had not been in a distressful and humbling condition, she would have, undoubtedly, received not a little conSolation from a behaviour which did Mrs. Burton So much honour. How many people have I Seen conferring favours with a haughtinefs mortifying beyond expression ! A haughtinefs
which
The Affected Indifference. 95
which did no credit either to their heads, or to their dispositions. There is a Soinething in our nature which prompts us to aim at independence ;. as every generous boSom necessarily wishes to give, rather than to receive: to oblige, rather than to be obliged. To Succour the unfortunate, to provide for the fa-therleSs, to wipe away the widow’s tears — theSe- are pleafures becoming a rational creaturepleafures which can never pall ; pleaSures which will be heightened by refiedtion.—Are not Such pleasures deServing of our attention, and can we be too studious to improve them ?
But to return to Mrs. Burton : she continued to charm me by telling Mrs. Leland in the Softest, and most benevo-j-lent accents, that she was obliged to her for the 'favour ;she did her in So freely
offering
9si The Affected Indifference.
offering to make herfelf neceffary to her.—“ But I hope, madam, ” added the humble, the exemplary Caroline, while tears of compassion rushed into her eyes^
“ I hope to be able, very Soon, to think of a Situation more Suitable to you, and 1 must desire your leave to inform you of it whenever it is in my power. ”
The modest widow role, and, with a graceful curtSy, assured her that she should think herSelf but too happy in deServing the favour she shewed her, by an unremitted assiduity about her perSon, if she would permit her to have the honour of attending her.—Then, casting , her eyes, timidly, on Burton and me, she added—“ I will .take a more convenient time to wait oayou, madam,”—and quitted the roomTV ^
As Soon as she was gone, the excellent | Mrs. Burton, turning to her hushand,
who

who had looked on her all the while with admiration, and laying her hand upon his shoulder, cried, “ I could not, my dearest love, I could not think of having Such a woman to be my ler-vant.—There is Something in her behaviour which discovers her very unfit for my place.”
Burton pressed his wife to his lips,' and to his boSom ; and I told them that I desired their leave to do every friendly -office to Mrs. Leland in their stead.
“ You will always rife Superior to me,’ WalSingham,” replied Burton; “ but as there" are favours to be conferred upon the widow which will come better from my wife^ than from any man., you must not re-fuSe the assistance of my Sympathizing Caroline.” -	'	>*

' She started at the sight of me •. a delicate glow was Spread over her fine, countenance. She is, really, very hand-^ Some.
< I opened my design by telling her, that I believed I could be of Service to her, if she would but condefcend to place foiine coiifidence in-me, by employing' me.
She Seemed to be abashed, or rather Surprised at my-offer; which I repeated with much frankneSs, and pressed her So earnestly to accept of it, that she, at length. Sat down, and burst into tears.
Good God! ” cried she, “ are you a man, sir,, or an angel, appearing thus, | unexpededly, to my relief ? ’’	!
“ Be

“ Be composed, dear Mrs. Leland,” Said . I, taking her hand, “ donst hurry your-' Self”—perceiving that she trembled, and was exceedingly agitated—“ I will call a^ain when it is more convenient—to-morrow, or any other time you shall ap-^
_ point; ”—rising to go.
“ No, pray, sir, ” Said she, stopping me—“ pray let me give you no more trouble than is neceffary. **
‘ I then Sat down, and she addrested me ' in the following manner ;
“ My hushand, sir, having Ipent both his own fortune, and what little I brought him, - recommended me, on his death-bed, to the proteftion of his brother, who not only refuSed to assist me, but declared that he must Sue me for a thoufand pounds which he had lent Mr, Leland; telling me at the Same time,' with a very mortifying harshneSs, that I ' F 2	, , must

must<pay the money immediately, or go to jail, as he could produce living witnesses to the loan of that Sum. ’*
I alked her if she had ever heard iier liushand mention Such a debt .N - “ Never, fir.—He always told me that Richard Leland his brother was .under the greatest obligations to liim, '.and that he would, therefore, recom- • mend me to his care.

The modest diffidence with which > Mrs. Leland related her story, the simplicity of her manner, and the noblenefs of Spirit, which urged her to throw her-Sclf into a way of life So much beneath her former Situation to pocure a SubSiIt-ence, pleaSed me extremely, and I commended her resolution. I told her, that I believed I could think'of a more eligible fettlement which would meet with her approbation; but that the Settlement projetsted by me, could not be adjusted till we had silenced Her troubleSome brother. I then begged her again to make herSelf eaSy; adding, that I would call the next morning to look over Mr. Le-land’s papers, that I might be the better able to instrLKst my lawyer; desiring too, that I might be her banker, till her

affairs were fettled. I put a fifty pound bank note into her hand, and before she had time to make any reply, ran out of the houSe.
Calling again at the hour I had named, I found her full of gratitude, but-very desirous to return the note; telling me that she could never be in a situation to repay me; and that if she could but get into a Service, she should not want any money for herSeif.
“ But you muji have money, madam,” Said I, ‘‘ to fee counSel, to pay lawyers bills. I 'beg, therefore, that you -will neither fay any more about Such trifles, nor think about them: I only beg that you will favour me with a sight of your , papers, that I may write immediately to ' town. ”
' She complied, and, in a manner, which convinced me both of the gopdneSs of
her
'	I
The Affected Indifference. 103
her heart, and of the strength of her understanding.
When my buSineSs was done, we entered into a conversation in which she discovered much more fenSe and Spirit, than I had expefted.
How could Such a woman ever think of demeaning herSelf by Servitude ! It must never be thought of. Such a woman is a companion for a prince. She reminds me, frequently, of Lady Frances: there is Something in the turn of her countenance. Something too in her air, which reSembles that charming creature. She is older, indeed, and is, by disappointment and perturbation, worn a little; but she may, notwithstanding, be reckoned a desirable woman.—Exquisitely So, is the lovely capricious disturber of my peace !

She Speaks of him in the highest terms—He has found out an itimufement for himSelf; the detail of his new proceedings takes up a great part of Mrs. Burton’s letter.

<■ I have had another Letter from Mrs. Burton ; she again earnestly intreats me to come to Datchet for change of air.— ’ What a request is this ? No body, except So young a woman who has Scarce Seen any thing of the world, would have made it. Does she not know that Wal-fingham is in the very houSe to which she has invited me ? Indeed, Bab, she is more thoughtleSs than a meer girl.—I'he little Lou iSa would not, I believe, have committed So capital a blunder.—I wonder that Burton, who is a man of SenSe, a man of the world, should not have acquainted her with the impropriety of her . invitation. But she means well. Besides they know, I Suppofe, that Walsingham is too much engaged with his widow, to ' fall a great deal in my way, yet, as we

Just before I was taken ill, I met with' Colonel Floyer at Lord Grover’s, at whoSe houSe Lady Haverford and 1 Spent the day.—Floyer told me that every body thinks he will either marry her, or attach himSelf to her for life; by either of theSe proceedings he will, I am alSo informed, give great diSpleaSure to his family, who wish to See him married to a Lady Suitable in point of rank, if fortune should be disregarded. He has only a daughter, you know, by Cecilia ; and the want of an heir occaSions no Small murmur-ings among a Set of very worthy uncles and aunts. Family-pride is, undoubtedly, a foosish passion; and yet every

body must be hurt to fee Such a man as WalSingham united to So low a woman. I • was a little SupriSed, I own, at his Jirfi ' choice ; and you may lie Sure I am still more astonished at this fecond.- Yet are not all men inconsistent creatures, Bab ? Had you Seen him at my feet when he ' So ardently prefiedfor my hand, you would have Said—you would have almost been ready to declare in the Solemnest manner—that he was the most impassioned, the Sincerest of men.—Now, as he has, in So short a time, totally forgot me, as -he is become deSperately enamoured with this woman, I am naturally inclined to believe that he might not have been So very constant, if I had conSented to the accomplishment of his wishes.

Besides, to confeSs the truth, I feel fenSations Swelling in my heart, which prompt me to wish that this amiable woman may have fortitude enough to rife Superior to temptation. I dare affirm that intereji will never hurry her into any indiScretion; but as she is poffest of an uncommon share of Sensibility, and as I am, you know, a very insinuating fellow, I will not pretend to anfwer for conSequences.—It is, undoubtedly, therefore, highly incumbent on us both to be upon our guard : but then by a guarded behaviour on both

Mrs. Leland’s affairs will, I hope, through my interposition, be Soon accommodated, in a-manner advantageous to her: I hope, too, that the raScal, her hushand’s brother, will be obliged, not only to relinquish his claim to any of the deceaSed’s remaining effetsts, but alSo to restore what he had iniquitoussy demanded and Seized, as due to him.

Lady Franees, now, were she and I upon our former friendly footing, would, with pleaSure, I dare fay, assist me upon Such an occasion : her heart overflows with benevolence; and yet though love is So nearly allied to. that noble passion, I could not find a single Spark of it in her boSom, at least, not for me.

You have a right to visit your relations and friends whenever it is agreeable to you, as well as he. By shifting the Scene, you will, I . hope, re-establish yoiir health, and find all your uSual vivacity restored—Besides-, the meeting between you and Walsingham, by appearing accidenfkl, will ‘reconcile you to khe sight of him, anci enable you to behave with the eaSe and indifference with which you would wish to behave when you happen to be near each other in publick; and meet in pub-lick Sometimes, you certainly will.

Besides, are you not your own mistreSs ? Let them fay what they pleale.
Is there not a SatisfatShion arising from tlie pleaSure we give ourSelves, preferable to that which we can possibly feel by all our attempts to gain the voices of the million, who, if a woman takes, ever So much pains to oblige them, are not the more contented with her ?

When a woman rejecsts a man, she is not under a necessity of vowing never to fee him again, or to Speak to him. She rather, in my humble opinion, owes him more civility than another perSon, for the great compliment he has paid her by being willing to paSs his life with her; and if WalSingham had made the offer pf his hand to me., I Should never have thought it necessary for me to shun him, though I had not listened to his overtures.—You cannot be injured by feeing WalSingham, becauSe you have ever conduced your-Self with the greatest propriety, except in this last affair—What could have induced you to refuSe his offer, but a diS-like to the man who made it} By harbouring a dishke to him., you can only G 5	be

By So doing she deprives Some man of'an amiable and deferving wife,< and the world of an exemplary mother, fit to educate children who might be uSe-ful and ornamental members of Society. With regard to Ashbury’s fancies a-, .bout W^fijighani-rr^while you are Sure they were only fancies-, and that there was no foundation for them, they ought to be treated as< fancies.

—This agreeable woman has affe(fi:ed me more than any of her Sex have done,

When I had received her account from my lawyer entirely adjusted, and accompanied with bills for five hundred pounds, which I had taken care to make the brother refund—yon understand me r—I presented them to her, expressing my concern at the Same time, that no larger a Sum could be obtained for her; and begging her to look upon me always as her Smcerest friend, and to employ me without any ceremony or reServe, whenever she stood in need of my assistance.. She bowed, blushed, looked earnestly at me, and at the bills, alternately, as if

she had'Some ‘fuSpicions, but was not willing to appear SuSpicious, and .then rising, stepped into the next room.—Returning in a ‘short time, she put the fifty pound note I had given her, intq my hand, and thanked me for the loati of it. I was charmed with the modest timidity with which she gave it me, for she Seemed fearful of offending me, while she appeared to think it absolutely necessary for her to repay me; shut as she could'not imagine that I should’ever want So trifling a Sum, I placed it in her ' hand again, and intreated her to lock it up as a part of Mr. Leland’s effedts.— “ It is truly,” added I, “ a part of them, as we cannot, immediately, get every thing out of his brother’s hands.”—“ No sir,” replied she, with great emotion, “ no fir; I See through your generosity, but it must not be carried too far. I

“ You have made Sufficient acknowledgements, madam,” Said I, “ by the acceptance of Such trifles, which can only be for your preSent-uSe. Something farther must be done,” continued I,
“ when you can think of a mode of living ■ agreeable to you.” -—“ I cannot, just now-,” replied she, “ think oft receiving Such valuable favours from you, sir, which will be, indeed, uSelefs to me, as I am determined to endeavour to pro-^ cure a Subsistence by waiting on a Lady.

titude for your generosity.”—“ Pray do not mention the word generosity, madam,” anfwered 1—“ The Satisfacstion which I feel by having, in any shape, contributed to your happineSs, is So great, that I fear you will find little merit in my behaviour: but if you really imagine . that you are under obligations to me, you have it in your power amply to repay me, by allowing the justneSs of my taste in having distinguished you from all your Sex, and permitting me to employ . all my thoughts about you.”
I went too far here, D*Arcy’; I am very SenSible I did; but I really felt e-	'
very word I uttered, and more: only 1 should not have, perhaps, discovered my feelings; for the dear creature was thrown

expressed as forcibly, it is probable, by her. silence, than if the most grateful effusions had streamed from her ruby lips, I caught her trembling hand, and carried it, involuntarily, to my mouth.—
She made no attempt to withdraw it for Some time.—-She adlually Seemed to be in a delirium of joy.
On a Sudden recovering herSelf, she started out of the reverie in which she was plunged, and cried, “ Good God! what am I about ? let me go, sir—this situation is by no means proper for me.**
— Then, with a heart-fetched sigh, while her eyes confessed every emotion of her foul, added, “ The difference between us is too great.’*
“ No, my dearest Mrs. Leland,** replied I: “'The warmest friendship may Subsist between people in different Spheres of life—I have been, hitherto, engaged '

Tou^ by having had So much leiSure for reading and re-fieclion will, furnish me with perpetual entertainment; and as I have mixed with the gay w’^orld, I hope I shall be able to ■ enliven your Serious hours.”
She blushed, but made no anSwer. She Seemed again to be buried in thought:
I strove to amuSe her with Several different topics, and she assented by faint- ' Smiles to what I Said; but she did not appear really more chearful. Thinking it possible, therefore, that she might chuSe to be left a little to herfelf, I roSe, and took my hat. She again begged me to reSume my bills—I affured her that they belonged to her^ and that I could

To avoid any farther ^ altercation upon the Sishje(st, I hurried down stairs, and out of the houSe, with my heaei and heart So full of the good Senfe, disinterestedneSs, delicacy, and let me flatter mySelf, rapturous tenderneSs of this amiable woman, that I did not recover mySelf in an hour.
I am quite a fool, D’Arcy, with regard to women. They gain, by their winning mariners.

He comprehended the full meaning of my acknowledgements, for he bowed again, and kept a reSpedtful distance, as if he imagined I should be offended if he came too near me ; though, to be Sure, I only fancied that his thoughts were So much employed about me : for he is too much attached to Mrs. Leland to bestow a single thought upon Lady Frances Ashbury. Impelled by his natural humanity, he flew to my assistance when I was ready to faint; and he would have done So, had I been old, ugly, or one of the meanest of my Sex. This consideration restored me entirely to mySelf;

cd to she her So altered. I started at the intelligence; but when I entered the Saloon, and beheld her emaciated, though a lovely figure, and Saw the emotions which my Sudden appearance occasioned in her; wonder gave way to a thouSand Soft SenSations, and I could not restrain myfelf from Hying to Support her, as she was sinking under the violent op-preshon upon her Spirits.—My compaS-Sion not only revived, but increaSed all my former tenderneSs ; and I ashsted her with an eagerneSs which discovered how Sensibly I was affedcd at the sight of her disorder : but immediately perceiving that she looked exceedingly diSconcerted at my freedom, which she, probably, thought impertinent or troubleSome, as she had rejected me, I withdrew, kept the distance she appeared to expefh, and paid her all the deference due to her

Sex and rank.—By that change in my behaviour, I occasioned an immediate alteration in hers. She Soon recovered, and behaved with an astonishing eale, and unaffedled coolneSs, which Sufficiently convinced me that I never had made the wished^for impression on her.—Shall I own, D’Arcy, that her coolneSs drove me diredtly to Mrs. Leland, to find in her unreServed Society, that Satisfaction which was never to be expected from the company of Lady Frances } My Letitia—ought I to call her So ?— was hot only pleaSed to fee me, but discovered an unuSual SoftneSs, and a real tenderneSs which were infinitely Soothing, just at the very moment when I had been So affetsted by the caprice of Lady Frances — for I mtiji accuSe her of ca-' price., as she fometirhes appears to, be exceedingly pleafed with me, and Some-H 4	times

Letitia’s carriage, therefore; awakened every gentle passion in my mind ; it -made me more ready both to , give, 'and eager to receive, every little advantage which is allowable in a tete a ■ tete with an amiable woman Mrs. Le-land is indeed uncommonly amiable.

She blushed and struggled a little,' but Soon grew ' compoSed—jthough the indulgences, with • which I was favoured by her were accompanied with sighs and dejefted looks.
I was exceedingly touched with the anxiety which was viSi ble in her coiin tenance.

in a man who was So warmly, So Sincerely, her friend ; but I coufd not prevail on her to give me any fatisfatstory aniSwer ; y,et I thought she beheld me with inexpressible tenderneSs, and Seemed unuSually affedled with every thing I Said to her.
I became, inSensibly, more attentive to * her than ever, and my attentions were received in a very flattering manner.^ Recolledling, on a Sudden, that I aft-ed very rudely, by abSenting mySelf the very night on which Lady Frances arrived at Datchet, I took out my watch, roSe, pressed the hand of one widow, and hastened to the other.
In my way to the latter I refle;(fl:ed sh ferioufly upon what had passed between me and Mrs. Leland, that I began to think I had gone too far both on her account and my own.—To marry her I never intended, and my principles will H 5	not

not permit me to take her into keeping: ^ were she ever fo well inclined to be my ■ mistrefs, I could not bear to fee So amiable a wonian So lowered in my esteem. Besides, I am arrived at a period of life when I ought to look upon myfelf as a family-man-^Had my Cecilia lived, 1 ■should not have been thus embarrassed. Situated as I am at prefent, I am afraid that Mrs Leland’s pershnal channs, and pleasing conversation, and the frequent ihd. a tttes have enjoyed together, shave had a stronger effedl upon me than I imagined they would have had,—I have certainly, thrown mySelf into a very diSagreeable situation; .yet I am still more distrest by encouraging Mrs. Leland to believe I am enamoured with her; I am really enamoured with her; but iri my prefent circumstances, I ought to have concealed my passion from her
with
The Affected Indifference*' 1^5
with the utmost caution: for as I cannot think of marrying her, I should not have given her the least reaSon to Suppofe'I am in love with her: and yet I could Sooner die than negle<5t her, or even discover the least indifference for her I should ad meanly, by negleding her, and cruelly, to be indilferent j as I cannot help Seeing that she looks upon me with very partial eyes.—All I fear is, that by the assiduities to which I have been, in* voluntarily, prompted, 1 have encouraged emotions, that will lead us both into unwarrantable situations. — I am, however, fo strangely infatuated with this bewitching woman, that I cannot stay away from her, though Lam but too Sensible that my frequent visits increafe her prepossessions in my favour.
With thefe ressedions rolling in my mind, I returned to Burton’s,—I found H 6	Lady

Lady Frances as I had left her. During Supper she extremely shocked me, by the increased paleneSs of her face, and by her entire loSs of appetite. — Can I, possibly, love two women at the Same .time, D’Arcy,. and to be So violently diSquieted about them ? Surely I cannot.-j—After having remained for Some .moments in a deep reverie, I felt my-Self really attached to Lady Frances, and looked upon Mrs. Leland only as .a woman who merited ,,my compassipn. And does not compassion for an amiable, agreeable woman, border cloljely upon , love.^ The affedlionate esteem, indeed, which she diScovers for me naturally excites a return: but then this very return must strengthen her partiality for me; and it will, of courSe, injure her in every shape, as her connexion with me cannot be a diScreet one—-But 1 may

Thus have I fairly stated the cafe as it at preSent stands with regard to Mrs. Leland; but were Lady Frances to get over her falle delicacy (for So I must call it) and shew a willingneSs to accept of me, all my difficulties would Soon be removed. She would then reign — She has always reigned — the Sovereign mif-trcSs of my foul: and she would, I am Sure, assist me in making a proper provision for Mrs. Leland: a provision Suitable to her merit, which she might enjoy without the least injury to her charadler.

He came, and preScribed riding—I offered my little horfe to her—which is, you have often Said, only fit for a woman. She neither refuSed nor accepted my offer : I, therefore, ordered the horfe to be brought, with the hunter I generally ride.—Mrs. Burton had prepared her friend. When she came down, I ventured to Solicit the honour of attending her. I Seized her, Seemingly,

She looked like a Diana' ready to punish the daring Ac-tason, but discovered no adlual diS-pleaSure at my freedom. I strove, by all tite eloquence I was master of, to banish every diSagreeable idea from her mind; and I hope I Succeeded, as she Smiled, Sweetly Smiled, and cast Such glances of Satisfatstion at me. — I hope she was not difgusted with my- Solicitude about her, which-! could not check —-I love her still.'—I find I still love her.—I adlually trembled lest she should Suffer any inconvenience from her'morning’s excursion, as she is in So weak a state.' 1 was too much affedted to be- .

She withdrew it but ssowly, and, apparently, with rather a timidity, ever attending a real passion, than from any dissike—This timidity, with the languor Swimming in her lovely eyes, filled my whole Soul ..with an unuSual SoftneSs'.

I followed her fiowly, not being willing to alarm her too much, and taking another chair very near her, afked her, why, after having given me Such an infinite deal of pleaSure by So animating a confession, she had contradidted herSelf by So Sudden a reServe.
“ I have been very indiScreet sir,” replied she, “ but it is yet in my power, I hope, to repair my errors. I do not wish to recall my words.

Mrs. Burton, having Seen her before, very properly, you knowi called to alk her how she did. She introduced me as a relation, and particular friend, and

in order to apologize for her enquiring, before me; if ssie was Settled at Datchet.-.
Mrs. Leland repsied, “ As I have not been So happy,, madam, as to merit your place, I have applied to Lady Ten-net, and her Ladyship has promifed to. try me: I have no favour, madam, to aSk of you, but to beg you would Speak favourably of me to her Ladyship, if she should happen to mentioit me.” This request,* Bab, was delivered witK ' a modest dignity which prejudiced me extremely in her behalf; and I anSwered —“ I know Something of Lady Tennet. Mrs. Burton and T am afraid that your dispositions will not Suit. — Will you give me leave, madam, V continued I, addressing mySelf to Mrs. Leland,. “ to offer you all the affistance in my power ? You'have not been bred to a life of SerS ' .vitude; I fear, therefore, that Such a ‘	life

life will not be agreeable to you. If you should prefer the millenary way, I will undertake to furnish you with all requisites for Such, an employment; and I ' think I can anSwer for your SucceSs: you, certainly, shall not be on the losing fide.”
I waited a moment before 1 proceeded, becaufe I wished her not to reply till she had considered of my propoSal: but the grateful creature could hardly be kept from throwing herSelf at my feet to thank me—“ It is the life, madam,” Said she,
“ which I should have choSen, had I been in the possession of a Sum Sufficient to place me in So defirable a situation.—
I only desire, madam, to thrive by honest industry.”	N .	'
I cannot tell how I behaved upon this occaSion : I only know that my eyes were filled with tears; and I felt my Self
quite

quite happy in having it in my power to Serve a woman with So valuable a mind, in having thought of a method So agreeable to her disposition.
When we roSe to go, I promiSed Mrs. Leland to call upon her in a day or two at farthest.
She curtsied, and thanked me.
When we left her, I could not help wondering, for wy.part, how it happened that WalSingham, with his known generosity, should have converged So long with So amiable a woman, without offering to make her, in Some shape, eaSy in her circumstances : but men are strange, inconsistent creatures.
I desired Mrs. Burton to take no notice to WalSingham of what had passed, and she promiSed she would not. I think I will talk to him mySelf upon this Subject. There can be no great attachment

there was Such a Sweet expression in the sine, languid countenance of Lady Frances. She looked at me with compassion, and Softened her voice when she Spoke to Such a bewitching tone, that I could have almost Sworn she loved me. I was not mistaken, you know, with regard to Mrs. Leland: jhe honestly owned her Sentiments, and oppoSed an inclination which she believed to be indiScreet.— Well—why may not Lady Frances love., but at the Same time imagine that an attachment to me may appear imprudent Women have whimsical fancies Sometimes.

When I had Settled Mrs. Leland’s little affairs, Walsingham came to me one .morning, when I was alone, and thanked me, in the highest terms, for my generous behaviour to the amiable widow —(I had not affected to conceal the part I took in her distreSs, nor had I talked ^ of it to any body, except Mr. and Mrs. Burton) adding, that he had intended to Solicit for her the very favour I had conferred, as he thought her extremely deserving, and as she would accept of no favours from him.
“ No !’* anSwered I, willing to hear

I believe I looked exceedingly disconcerted; yet I had preSence of mind e-nough to Say—Improper offers, Mr. Walsingham, ought always, you know, CO be refuSed.”
“ I will .readily allow that Such offers ought to be refuSed, Lady Frances; and will alSo, honestly own, that I am ashamed of my Self for having affronted Mrs. Leland, by making any Such propoSals; but the

Do itot laugh at me, if I con-feSs that I feel an additional Satisfadtion to that arising from a conScioufneSs of having done a benevolent adlion, in knowing that this formidable woman is-planted quite out of Walfingham’s way, and in a style of life to exclude any honourable defigns on his fide, as he will certainly never think of marrying a woman who keeps a publick shop: and for ihe’Sake of his family^ you know,

Walfingham and I are as distant and as civil as if we were utter Strangers to each other. Lady Mary and Mrs. Burton take his part with regard to his behaviour to Mrs. Leland. They Say that her carriage, though he might have put a wrong construdtion upon it, was well intended; and only blame her for having told him that she loved him, as she, by that unguarded confession encouraged him to make improper propofals to her, proposals which he had, indeed, atoned for by an offer of marriage.

They are silent about the infult; but they are of opinion, that though Mrs. Leland afled right by rejefting WalSmg-ham, her refufal ought not to influence ' any other woman, whom he addreffes in an honourable manner, against him: they add, that as his charadler was never, in the Slightest degree, impeached before, this single failing ought to be overlooked, even by a woman of delicacy.

I arrived here last night. The wind not being fair, I put up at the principal inn: beSpoke a chicken for my Supper, went to bed early, and ordered my Servant to call me when the pacquet was ready to Sail. *
As no change happened all night, I role in the morning, and drank my tea vvith much compoSure.
On a Sudden a chaiSe and four galloped into the yard, attended with Servants. A Lady immediately, in a negligee, with a hood over her face, and her attendant got out, and were conducted by the rnaster of the houSe into a room adjoining to that in which I was at breakfast.—There was an uncommon dignity in her mien, 'and she. moved in the most graceful manner imaginable, though she hurried in, holding the lace of her hood quite over her face with her

hand. Her companion followed her, in a bonnet, and Seemed to be not in the least deSirous of concealing herSelf fironi me: instantly I recognized the features of Mrs. Bland, Lady Franceses woman.
—Heaven and earth ! how my heart throbbed and fluttered at the bare idea of Such a rencontre ! “ Lady Frances !
, Surely it cannot be,” thought I— “ no~ impossible : yet I must enquire. ”—I, then Summoned my fellow immediately, who though, in general, very reSpedlful, replied with a Smothered grin, upon my ashing who’ the .Dady was — “ Lady Frances Ashbury.”
“Are you Sure of what you Say.'*”	,
replied I. — “I am not in a humour to be trifled with.”
“ Upon my life and Soul, fir,” Said he, staring, with a Solemnity which .made ample amends for his former propensity
The Affected Indifference. 215
penSity to laugh, “ I have told you the truth. I just now Spoke to her Ladyship’s Servants.’*
“ Well then,” anSwered I, “ go and Speak with them again, and afk them whither her'Ladyship is going.”
He obeyed, and brought me back word that they could not tell.
“ Leave me then, for the preSent,” Said I, “ but keep a good look out; and if she makes any movements, inform me of them immediately.”
“ She is not going in a hurry from hence, fir,” replied he, “ for Mrs. Bland has ordered a dinner.”
All this, you may imagine, increaSed my Surprise—if it could be increaSed. I was half mad with impatience to fee her, and to heai' the motives which had urged her to So unexpedled a proceeding; but I considered that great circumSpec-

tion was necessary. I vvas very unwilling to give a new affront to her Ladyship’s ' delicacy. .There could not, however, be any impropriety in my desiring leave ' to wait on her — I should have been guilty, indeed, of an unpardonable rude- ' neSs, in taking no notice of her, when I knew that we were in the Same houSe together. j^Still, however, I hesitated, and could not conquer the dread of being again rejedled: yet I was wild to make a trial. At length I got the better of ail my retarding apprehensions, and Sent Salway, with my reSpeftful compliments, to desire the honour of waiting on her Ladyship. The anSwer w'as, that “ she should be extremely glad to See me.” Excellent ! thought I—and hurried Salway to dreSs my hair, which, effcuitistanced as I was, waiting to go aboard, had been 'quite negleded.
When
The Affected Indifference, 217
.When I was decent—and 1 could hardly keep my impetuosity within bounds, till my fellow had done — I flew into the apartment of my divinity,' who had never been So nearly upon a footing with a mere mortal in her life before. '	'
She received me, blushing like a rofc dropping with pearly dew, and with a tremor throughout her whole frame, which gave her a thouSand new graces which I Seemed not to See, and, consequently, allowed her time to recover herSelf.
When we had chatted a little while on common topics, the weather, the wind, Cs?r. and when I had irfformed her that I waited till the pacquet was ready to Sail, she'Said, with downcast eyes,’ and a gentle sigh, “ You are determined then to leaveEngland, Mr. Walfmgham ?*!

“ Will you permit me, madam, to condudl you to Paris, As I .have -been the Same route already, I may be capable of bei.ng of Some Service to your Ladyssiip.”	•	'
She blushed again, bowed, and thank- , ed me. in return, I invited mySelf to ' dine with her. I then told her that if she would give me permission, I would procure proper accommodations on board the vessel in which I had hired a passage.
She only assented by her Silence, aiid I left her. ..	: h sii: :

About an hour before we reached Calais, the wind blew very fresh, and there was So high a Sea, that she could not help discovering all the terrors natural to her Sex. There was, indeed, no possibility of her walking from the vessel; and I could not bear to See any body L 2	touch

She thanked me in the Sweetest accents for my care of her, and Suffered me to condudb her to the nearest hotel, accepting of my offered arm for her Support, y She shook,violently was she agitated, as if she had been in an ague-fit; and when I placed her in a chair, and called for Some refreshment, turned as pale as death.—-I desired leave to order dinner—She hardly tasted a morSel.

“ I am Sure that Mr. Walsingham would condemn Such a design,” replied she, “ were I weak enough t0‘ carry it into execution.—My friendship for him., indeed, has prompted me to'take a step, which he, I fear, as well as. the world, will sharply cenfure ; but I confeSs I could not bear to think of parting with him for ever, without wishing for another adieu.—I have followed you, to take a last farewel, and I leave you to purSue your journey.—I am ashamed of my folly, yet ”—■
She would Have proceeded,, but tears and sighs deprived her of the power of utterance—and I was ib full of wonder, and So transported, that I had not the Slightest inclination to interrupt her.’ L caught her hand, indeed, and Sat gazing on her face, devouring every ' feature, and longing to wipe away every 'c *	E 4	falling.

falling tear.—^Finding that she was fi-' . lent from a distreSs which, while it rendered her a thouSand times more dear to me, called for immediate relief; I ventured to catch her in my arms, to fold her to my throbbing boSom, and to alk her, in accents as tender as hers, if she would permit me to silence the world, and her own fears, and to gratify my ardent wishes, by making her mine for ever. ”	i
She blushed like crimSon.—She strove to withdraw herfelf from my arms: she struggled; she trembled. —■ Still gently holding her hand, I alked her why she made fo cruel a resistance to my defires and to her own.—“ As you have kindly - confessed, my dear Lady Frances,” continued I, “ that you entertain a friendship for me Sufficient to render you af-fedted by my abSence, why will you
not
The Affected Indifference. 225
not permit me to See friendship, by the tenderest attentions on my side, ripen into love ? Come, come, you will, you must.—The world will talk, stis, ' true; and there is but one vray to put a stop to its talking r do it by confenting to be mine immediately. A clergyman of our perSuaSion may be found even here, and he may unite us in a short time ; and then we may defy the utmost malice of a tattling multitude, envious, of our mutual happineSs./*'
The dear, delicious little prude aveVt-. ed her face while I addressed the above Speech to her; and,, by So doing,. diS^ covered the most elegantly polished neck, and finest profile imaginable. I Suffered her to remain in that attitude for Some moments, merely for the pleaSure of gazing on her. My impatience then to fecure- the delight which I enjoyed,, hur-I-* 5	ned

ried me to rife, and to prefs her So eagerly to grant my request, that she turned with half a Smile, and cried, “ What would you have, Mr. Walsing-harri ^ I cannot be teaSed, indeed I cannot.-”
“ You shall not be teaSed, my life; only let me engage a proper perSon to perform the ceremony, and I will leave you to recover your Spirits. ”
“ I cannot, indeed, ” replied she, “ 1 cannot think of Such a thing, without a friend, and in a foreign country.—It is impossible, indeed Mr. WalSingham. ” “ Indeed then. Lady Frances, ” an-fwered I, rather in a peremptory manner—“ I must come to terms.—If yo\.i will not confent to be married as Soon as we arrive at Canterbury, at which place I have a particular friend in one of the prebends, I must take a final

leave of you here, and Set out for Parb to-morrow morning, for I cannot bear to be tantalized any longer. ”
I then rofe, and walked about the room. “ If you are So indifferent, fir, ” re-.plied file, with an agitated voice, “ we must part, for I cannot agree to a<5l in opposition to all decency. ”
“ Nor will I alk you, my angel,” Said I, Sitting down by her again, “ to do any thing which may shock iyour delicacy, that charming delicacy which has hitherto So railed you in my esteem. —But, my dear Lady Frances, your own excellent understanding will tell you, that even delicacy carried too far degenerates into downright prudery; that the exceSs of every thing is wrong; and that we can only gain the approbation of our own consciences, and render ourSelves_reSpe<5table to others, by regulat->	.	.	ing

I can have no rest till I have Secured the perSon,, as well as the heart of her who is So necessary to my felicity.—It is neither:indifference nor indelicacy which urges me to inSist upon your compliance with'my request; k is my impatience which impels me to complete my own happineSs, and to Spare your blushes at the Same time.—^Come—give me’this dear hand for ever,' and let me. hide that Sweet glowing face'in my boSom. - j “ Say namore;” anSwered she',* “ but leave me now, Mr.’Walfingham, I cannot talk any longer upon this Subjed.

I kept my word, bowed, left her, and fat down to write to you, knowing that you would enjoy the intelligence I had to communicate to you.~If Lady Frances deceives me again, I, will never fee her or England any more.—But I wrong her by harbouring any SuSpicions'against her: has site not, by following me; given me the most indisputable proof of her tea-derest attachment to me ?	.

Here we are Safe arrived; and, let, me add, the happiest pair ^ in the univerSe. We had a very stormy passage. During that passage, my Fanny was not only glad to be Supported in 'my arrsis, * but'every nibment accuSed herSelf of having led me into unnecessary danger, and confessed that she loved me, that she had ever loved me with the most impassioned tendemeSs ‘ frorn ‘ our first aciquaintance.	‘	'
Imagine my raptures^ .D’Arcy. I blessed the storm which had extorted So transporting an avowal from her, and told her that I would contentedly be drowned for the Supreme Satisfadlion of being affured I was beloved by her.
She

She chid me for my unSeaSonable levity, with her charming eyes full of tears, and pressed me still cloSer and cloSer to her delicious boSom, while the danger continued.
Take my advice, Charles — Never , marry a woman who owns her pashon when she is first Solicited, but stay and take one who has quite tired you out with repeated refuSals.—Such a one will
catch at yon eagerly, at last, as if to
Save herSelf from perdition; and, by a
rapturous stow of undissembled love, no
longer to be confined, lift you above
mortality. Such a woman is my Fanny,

OH! Bab ! were I to relate the adventures of this last week, how would you blush for your friend f Yet she has been onlv weak—she has not adted criminally: indeed she has not.— But can I allow it to be a weakneSs to be affedtionately attached to So amiable a man as WalSingham is ? He has convinced me, he alone could convince me— ,that an overadled delicacy, like every,

but I am amply recompensed for what I have done, by being unjted by the strongest ties to the man who made the tenderest of hushands, to a woman whom ■ he married rather from a point of honour than from inclination; and who lets me fee, every hour, that he is more passionately attached to your happy friend, than he ever was to any woman in the world.
