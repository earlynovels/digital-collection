My situation was. inexprestibly painful. In vain I remonstrated to my father. If I had not virtue e-nough, he Said, to resist, when I knew the conSequence of a Surrender, it must be weak indeed : nor would he give a fig for that virtue which was not put to the proof. My education, (he would add) my pride, and the honour of my family, ought to be my Security.

Thiis might be true, but yet he was 1 certainly to blame, in constantly ■ Subjecting me to the arts of the most I Seducing man in England. My dif- I fidence of mySelf magnified the danger.

my beauty. No man ever better understood the art of delicate flattery than Sir George ; for most Successfully had he Sacrificed to the Graces.
My father has a large acquaintance. The constant gaiety that reigned at our houSe, rendered it a favourite reSort for the beau monde. Our female visitors were not Such as 1 Ihould have choSen for my companions : though people of Salhion, their morals were far from being rigid. By their witty ridicule, they So confounded virtue and vice, that I found it difficult to retain thoSe laudable principles which had with fo much pains been instilled into my youthful mind,
A life
14 THE RELAPSE,
A life of racket never could be agreeable to one of my pensive turn: I sighed for foHtude; for which you, my lively cousin, have, like the rest, ' often ridiculed me. I Spent half my nights in reading,^ for which the day afforded no leifure. The authors I perufed, gave me that romantic turn of which you accufe me: I fancied mySelf a most dif-treffed darnfel, and longed for Some courteous knight to deliver me; but my ideas of that knight were So foreign to every man I beheld in real life, that I was in little danger of putting myfelf under any of their protections. Sir George, who studied the dispositions of thofe whom he wished to pleafe, was indeed almost the fort of being I had fancied,.

ded, and for that reaSon, was the more to be dreaded; for when conversing with him, it was impossible to believe he was the faulty character the wprld reported ; of which, however, I was fatally convinced; fatally, I fay, since his libertine attempts drove me to take the imprudent step, for which I now fo Severely reproach mySelsi — Spare me . the particulars of a Scene, the recollection of which sills me with terror.
While on a visit at a lady’s houfe in the country, where Sir George alSo visited, he found an opportunity of being alone with me i an opportunity purpofely contrived, I have reaSon to believe, by the vile misirefs

of the houSe.—I struggled, I Screamed : no one came to my affistance :	i
a window being open, I leaped from ^ it, though pretty high, into the garden. Fear gave me wings : I rather fiew than ran; nor stopped till quite out of breath, and unable to proceed.
I looked round, and Saw, at a little distance, a pleaSant little dwelling, which I reached, with Some diffi-culty, quite exhausted with fatigue.
The door was opened' by a young country-looking lad, in a plain but neat livery. “ Pray let me rest my-felf,” faltered I, any-where, anywhere. O! I am quite faint!” He led to the parlourI went in :
A young gentleman fat on a couch, with a book in his hand. I had not time to mark his appearance; for I

found mySelf on the couch, and the gentleman holding a Smelling-bottle in his hand; which had contributed to restore me to life.
How stiall I give you an idea of this charming youth, my dear cousin, with that exprefiion of tender fympathy in his countenance } how defcribe the harmony of his voice, when with all the foftnefs of gentle compaffion he accosted me ? Then, indeed, my romantic turn began to operate, and, with all the eloquence of a distreffed damfel, I told him my fad tale, and Solicited his protedUon, while he hung over me, enamoured.

He is gone, dear Clara, and with him all my joy.—Early last Monday morning the post-chaiSe drove up to the gate: I heard its unwelcome found, and awoke my Sidley.— “ O my dear LouiSa,” cried he, my heart fails me now the painful hour of Separation is arrived !’* He started up, with visible alacrity. I hurried on my cloaths, to prepare his breakfast.—He looked extremely elegant in his travelling-drefs. I endeavoured to be chear-

The repast was Soon over:—John came in, — ‘‘ Every thing is ready.”
My weak heart died within me at the Sound.—Do not continue long % away, my Sidley,” my voice faltered.
‘ Only a few weeks at most, my love. Why thefe emotions for a short Separation ?’ “ Pardon me. Sir,
I know I am very filly; but I shall Soon recover myfelf, when I have leiSure for reflexion; and, you know,
I shall have time enough for that,” Smiling through my tears, when you are gone.” He folded me in his arms. ‘ I shall not,’ cried he, fervently, * prefs to my heart fo great / g	a trea-

I clalped my hands, in an agony, and running, with a kind of wildneSs, to the top of a little mount that over-I	looks the road, stood fixed, till my

I instantly concluded her. to be the long-streaded Lady ISabella : — nor was I deceived. — To her I owe my Sidley's freedom; and,,would we accept further favours, her liberal mind would know no bounds to her generosity : but we are already too much indebted. Sidley pines under a fenfe of the obligation, and, with more feverity than I can * bear, reproaches himfelf for his imprudence.

many amiable qualities. She is remarkably Sensible too. I esteem her, and would love her, if I could; nay. Sometimes, when Sidley behaves particularly referved to her, I fancy I do; for to be regarded with coolnefs by him, renders her an objedt of pity. He is grateful for her favours, more fo than the wifhes: stie fays, it is a mark of want of friendship, where an obligation is fo disagreeably felt:—but she should consider, that his temper, is hurt at prefent by his circumstances 5 and even to me, though he instantly recollects him-felf, he is Sometimes almost peevish.

A NOVEL.' 43 LETTER VIII.
Mr, Sidley to Mr. Summers.
OU Say true, my dear Sum-mersj it is our own pride which creates half the inSults we complain ofbut yet I had Some reafon to be diSgusted with the . treatment I met with : you, however, were too far distant to be. ap-[ plied to. How you would have f	adSed, even you, till adlually put to
j	the prpof, cannot tell; but as I

idea.

| i	not injure you, nay, who, on the
I	contrary, will promote your inte-
rest, while it is not incompatible
t '
with his own, is as much as one ought to desire in what is called a friend, and perhaps more than one has reaSon to expect.	j
