1KNOW too well the melancholly reaSon of your preSent silence, and do not preSume to interrupt it, or desire you to write till perfectly convenient; but the consideration of this day’s beginning a New Tear,, induces me to Send you my best wishes (not my compliments) on that occasion.

I petitioned that your valuable life might be prolonged beyond the common date of humanity; that your fen- \ sibility might never more be wounded by the loSs of a friend; that you might enjoy uninterrupted health and every Species of happineSs.
THE CORRESPONDENTS.	$
To * *.
T HAVE no Suitable return for your most kind wish. The Second article includes every thing; and is the best condolance I have received ; for on theSe occasions little to the purpoSe can be Said.
As to the rest, when I enjoy health I. am thankful; but there arc not many Species of happineSs that I can enjoy. People in advanced life, as their connexions dissolve, grow indifferent, and find their attachment to the world de-creaSe daily: the few pleaSures they can relish may generally be Safely afforded them. Your correspondence is numbered among the few that 1 regard : you will continue it to me, and accept my Sincere acknowledgments.

I have been amusing my Self theSe two hours with a piece of embroidery. This eaSy occupation engages the fingers without confining the thoughts; So, after a variety of ideas had ran . through my mind, I began on a Sudden to review my past life.
I contemplated the chequered Scene with stridt attention; and concluded at

length, that the white hours were infinitely more than the dark in number; and that, far from repining, I had abundant cauSe of thankfulneSs to that good Providence whoSe bounty had exceeded my deSert. Casting my eyes round, finding mySelf in a very comfortable retreat—independent of the world— tri'pYmgtolerable health,—a few friends still Spared to me—O Memory, thought I, what but thy annihilation is wanting to my happineSs! then I could enjoy theSe various blessings without the re-fiedlion of their uncertainty, without the dread of their Sudden loSs.—Here I broke off my meditation, and endeavoured to confirm my tranquillity, by communicating this account of it, which 1 know will afford a generous Satisfaction to your benign heart; a fatisfadion A 4	that

TH E Substance of your letter is a very agreeable leffon in moral phi-lofophy; but I wish you had omitted the conclusion. How often must I repeat that you owe me no obligation ? The ad of rendering you a Small Service was its own reward; and the endeavouring to improve our acquaintance into friendship was to pleaSe mySelf. Why then do we not converle upon equal term ? Why any refpefi ^ the ut-mojirejpefi, my mojl devoted? How am I to account for the uSe of theSe terms Can the trifling and accidental difference of our rank make any impreffiort on your mind.?—Impossible!—Your foul is undoubtedly Superior to that weaknefs.

Long life, as the gift of providence, is valuable, if employed to advantage; but an acquaintance with the world, a knowledge of mankind, can very Sel-domjirocure either reSpedl or happineSs. “ He that increaSeth knowledge in-“ creaSeth Sorrow.” Again, Says the Preacher, “ I considered all travel and “ every right work, that for this a man “is envied of'his neighbour.

Your last letter had very nearly put a period to our correspondence. “ All is vanity /” Tou are almofi tired of the world ! I neither doubt it, nor wonder, becauSe there are So few things, and So few people in it, that can possibly amuSe or engage a mind like yours. What preSumption in me to attempt either !—It is with reludance I fend this. Could I but know the time, the place, the circumstances, the disposition, in which you received my notes —but to intrude and break in upon your more important thoughts with Such frivolous insignificance!—Perhaps the very instant of reading this was devoted to a better employment.

WHEN I first proposed this friendly correspondence, you pleaded inability to maintain it; upon which, I promised never to write or require long or corred letters. A few artleSs lines, expressive of health, of friendship, of my thing but study and affedation,was all that I requested from yon, or gave you to exped from me.
I established at the fame time a very-unexceptionable conveyance', and promised to return your letters: in short, according to my notion of things, I removed every objedion that diffidence, discretion, or delicacy could Suggest.
Your letter intimates the contrary. You are now diffatisfied becauSc there

ceedingly ; his perSon was greatly favoured in a singular and very becoming drefs; and I thought I discovered Several new beauties in his adion . He drew tears from me without Speaking a word, in that Scene where his mother urges him to acknowledge himSelf her Son I and he with infinite emotion declines the explanation. TheSe tears were all 1 shed. I am Seldom much affeded by pompous declamation or high-wrought pashon ; and the poet had well nigh forfeited my pity for Mundane, by painting her So Savage in her revenge.
I waspieaSed with two circumstances in the exhibition of this piece, which I
never
THE. CORRESPONDENTS.	25
never remember to have Seen before ; one was, the stage being wholly covered with green cloth, which appeared quite proper, as the Scene lies without doors ; and prevented the abSurdity of bringing carpets to fall upon:—the other was. Seeing Mrs. Zates, in a Sup-poSed agony of terror, fall motionleSs to the ground without assistance.— The audience in general applauded this manoeuvre ; and Seemed Sensible how much better an effed it had then her being caught by attendents, whoSe unmeaning faces would probably have Spoiled ' the Scene.
Enough at this time for the patience of my noble reader, who will now, I hope, fign a free pardon for his reformed and penitent correlpondent.

Your pardon is undoubtedly signed, Sealed, and delivered ;—but I cannot greatly admire the epithet you bestow on m.e, and must beg leave to disclaim it. It is not your noble reader, but your friend, your good friend, who returns thanks for your letter ; and was very wellpleaSed withyourcriticiSm— Come then, let us hear a little more of the matter. Let us know what you are affeded by in dramatic representation, if not by declamation or passion : allb what Species of theatrical entertainment you prefer to the rest. Here is a large field, from which I exped a copious harvest. Adieu!
Yours very sincerely.
THE correspondents,
to *.
The field may be large, and thc harvest great; yet the labourer may not have strength to reap it. But this is not an apology; for I enter very cheerfully upon my talk.
My theatrical taste, then, (without farther preface) has undergone Several revolutions. When I was about half my preSent age, I admired nothing but pantomime, and the agile tricks of Harlequin, though, at the Same time, prompted by childish vanity, I affefted to deSpiSe them. Soon after that period, my taste really altered. Romeo and Alexander became my heroes, I was pleaScd with alternate sighing and storming; and the most extravagant Scenes B2	of
\
28	. THE CORRESPONDENTS,
of the most; extravagant tragedies appeared to me the noblest and most delightful. Weaned from this folly,- !, took a strong fancy to muftcal pieces,^on account of performing tliem on my own instruments; then aScending, as .1 thought, a full Scale in the climax of refinement, nothing would pleaSe me but the Italian opera : this, however, was a short-liv’d passion ; and was SuC’ ceeded by a fondneSs of the historical drama, and thofe plays that are uSually classed under the title oigenteel comedy \
' and theSe, with a few exceptions, continue my favouriteentertainments. Regarding the theatres as the mirror of human lifcj I prefer Such pieces as ressed in my notions the most agreeable representations of it: from hence arifes my admiration of ShakeSpeare. I have no
time
T-HE CORRESPONDENTS. 29
time to consider how he strains probability in his events, my attention is wholly engaged by the innumerable strokes of truth and nature in his cha-rafters. How amiable, how interestincr are Some of thbSe ! I am not o-oino to
O O
write apanegyricon thisimmortalbard, but I shall forever love and honour his memory, becauSe he is the only poet (that I know of) who has delineated to pCrfedion the charader of a female friend. Now, if to this {orntmardy critic should wittily objed, that ShakeSpeare created many imaginary beings, I will readily allow that, becauSe it does not affed this oharader. We wonder at the fairies, at the witches, at Ariel, at Caliban, but do we wonder at Celia? No, she is generally passed over with inattention, which alone is Sufficient to .	B 3	prove
30 THE CORRESPONDENTS.
prove that the charader is not uncommon, at least not mnatural; but it often proves more, it proves a fiowneSs in discovering the beauties of this . matchleSs writer.
Pray, pray, now, good lords of the creation, let us do justice to myfavou-riteheroine: whileDavid and Jonathan, Pylades and Orestes, Damon and Pythias, are So triumphantly held up on your side, let us at leasteredone^standard of friendship on our own, and inscribe it with the, names of Celia and RoSalind,
Consider then, in the first place, thc fituation of thcfe two friend.

And now let us recoiled thc conduct and Sentiments of this magnanimous girl.

Again, though we put felfishneSs out of the question, and the delight, never more to be known, which their friendship afforded, yet still we find cauSes enough to justify unceaSing regret. la the words of an admired author, “ We consider, with afflictive anguish, the pain we may unthinkingly have given ' them, and now cannot alleviate; and the losses we may have cauSed, and now cannot repair.

If we add to this the restedion, that they were Summoned from a state of being in which they were uSeful, and in which they would gladly have continued longer, it increafes our trouble to its highest degree,since almost every event, 'and even the most pleasing events, may revive their idea, with all the bitterneSs of compassionate grief.

Your letter which came yesterday awakened me from a very pleasing meditation on the rife, progreSs, and ' preSent state of our friendship, in which 1 had concluded it was established on So Solid a basis,- that neither time or chance (one accident excepted) could ever destroy it; and thus I argued the matter:
Friendship
92 THE CORRESPONDENTS.
Friendship between two perSons of the siime Sex, though extremely eafy to be formed, is liable to dissolution by a thouSand accidents, from which ours is Secure. Sometimes a difference in taste, Sometimes too great a similarity, Sometimes interest, and Sometimes love, will unite the Sacred knot. Friend-' ship between thoSe of differing Sex, is harder to form and to preServe. Put consanguinity out of the question, and where will you find your friends ? Single or married, old or ycung, if they are of equal age, their Sentiment is not friendship .... it is either too cold, or too h§t. Again, if their age differs considerably, their tastes will, in general, be too opposite. Will a young man Seek for animated pleafure in matronly conversation ? Can a matron

Let us SuppoSe that on the'ground of long acquaintance, astrid and more particular friendship is formed, between an old man tolerably free from the vices of his age, and a young lady still freer from the foibles of hers. We ought to SuppoSe, that they are both diS-engaged from the conjugal tie, and their Sentiments should be pretty much alike upon all Subjeds. We will allow tlie lady to fancy herjelf in Some reSpeds the inferior, parciculary in learn-

'' And now, pray what is your opinion of Such a connedion? Is it not well formed for duration ? Yea verily, and the rather for iti being of a gentle and placid kind, forming, as Somebody has

Once upon a time a poor widowed linnet (who unfortunately lost her mate in the hzxh2.xo\is, Jloooting-feafon, and who v^as not inclined to Seek another) found great difficulty in keeping the possession of her own Solitary nest. She had moreover the ill-fortuneto be entangled unawares in a net, which proved mostly fatal to birds of her size; for the Smaller ones often crept through the meshes, while thofe of Superior size and strength
could

could break the net and eScape. In this distreSs she applied to an eagle, that dwelt in xhtforeji adjacent, by whom she was ssightly known. This generous bird readily gave his assistance towards extricating her from the and afterwards continued to shew her great countenance and favour. Being un-uSed to thc conversation of linnets, he thought her rather more cleaver than ,the generality of that Ipecies, and even imagined that she might prove an-agreeable acquaintance.
Every one that knows any thing of natural history knows that birds, like' the human race, have many different degrees or classes of rank and precedence. The eagle, regardlefs of this, continued to visit the linnet, and in E 5	proceSs

proceSs of time, desirous of more frequent iuterviews, became urgent with Jier to remove into his neighbourhood, among the birds of distindion, alleging that she was extremely well qualified to figure in a higher Sphere,. The linnet knew better, but at length, with infinite jeludance, she yielded to over-perSua-fiDn, and forsaking her peaceful thicket, was introduced by the eagle to the beau-monde of the feathered creation.
The novelty of the Scene engaged a ' little attention at first; but Soon, too Soon, the grand mistake became visible. The linnet net qualified. She could * not sing like the blackbird, she could not display the rich plumage of the goldfinch, she could not converSe with the deep-learned falcon, nor join in she music of the nightingale,

A thouSand beaks were now opened against her, a thouSand reaSons given for her Sudden attempt ztpolitejfe, and all equally unfavourable. She could See the eagle, stis true, every day, but that.was no comfort, for every day brought new proofs that she was no companion for him. He wished her a hundred times at that distance, in which alone her merit appeared conSpicuous; but the removal was not without its difficulties. The birds whoSe Society she had left were now equally prejudiced against her, and she had neither Spirit nor interest to make new friends.^ Alas for the poor linnet: disregarded . by one party, diSowned by the other, she expired with mere shame and vex-i ation ; acquitting her benefador, and condemning only her own folly!

there is a singular, a very Jiriking ingenuity in the construdion of it; but' like other pieces oiancient writing, (for you know birds have not fpoke for fome ages) it is liable to divers readings, at the pleaSure of different critics. I could propoSe two emendations, one reSped-ing thc eagle as you call it, but which according to Le Pere and La Mere, never classed So high, and, in fine, was but a blackbird', and if you con-fult that venerable and deciSivc criuc.

You will laugh at my carrying this chimerical pride So far; but I adually triumpEm the notion that the state of literature in England was never more flourishing than in the reigns of Elizabeth andyfiiw.
I am not equally partial to the productions of modern writers of the other fex; and have Sometimes wondered to you So liberal in their commend^ tions. But one reaSon is, I am too apt to compare them with their immediate predecessors, many of whom, beheld at this favourable distance,and advantaged by jciir accounts of them.
