^)J0^^OU call me a happy, disst-^ Y ^ pated fellow: diffipated I cerr thinly am, but I fear I never shall be happy. You will, perhaps, be Surprised at my telling you that the women, the dear creatures who might make my life a life of joy, embar-

complaints are entirely occasioned by the confounded mode of modern female education. I cannot possibly afford to marry a woman who has been fashionably, 'that is extravagantly, li-centiously brought up from her infancy : .the naturally expenSive taste of Such a woman is by no means to be gratified by me. With my moderate fortune 1 cannot pretend to make my addresses to a fine lady with a Small one; and where is the woman with a large one who will condeScend to give me her hand ? I do not, indeed, wish to meet with Such a condescending woman: I detest all mer-cenary proceedings: I cannot bear the thoughts of taking a wife merely for the fake of her money—No chains for me, Jack, though golden ones. Fetters are fetters, of whatever materials they are constructed. Besides, when a woman
has
The Disinterested Marriage. 3
has made a man’s fortune, she is ex-tremely apt to expect too -many atten-tions from him—to Speak more plainly— to exerciSe a tyrannical power over him, especially if she finds him of a Submissive diSpoSition. Unequal alliances, either national or matrimonial, are Seldom pro-ductive of happy conSequences. In every SuppoSable connection in life we cannot hope for felicity from it, unleSs we are pretty much upon a footing with' the perSons to whom we attach Our-Seives. We are never eaSy; never com-fortable, with people greatly Superior to us;"'from^whatever Source that Superi-ority lariSes. You, and most of the young fellows of the age, will, I know. Sneer at theSe Gothic declarations, which have So little of the ton in them; but yoU will hereafter believe me, when you have past your burning meridian, be B 2	more

more inclined to fubScribe to them than you imagine you shall be. Young as I am myfelf, vigorous as my constitution is, and keen as all my appetites are * for joy, I Swear I could fit down with a woman, quite contented, provided that woman was not absolutely old, nor frightfully ugly. With a clean, good humoured. Sensible, fond wife, I could be as happy as if I was the delpotic master of a Seraglio of beauties.
With this turn of mind, this eafineSs of temper, is it not hard that I cannot meet with a woman to my taste ? — 1 will honestly confeSs, that a woman I mujt hatte: on a wife I cannot think of venturing.
“ You may take a girl mio keeping.^

True;

True; and that girl may be, most probably will be, ten times more proud.
Saucy, and extravagant than any wife— without bringing a shilling towards the Support of her current expences.
“ You may be kept yourfelf.”
WorSe and worst, a thcuSand times : Such chains are still more galling than thoSe of matrimony.
“ You must then amuSe yoyrSelf now “ and then with a stray nymph, or en-“ deavour to be upon good terms with “ Some martied women among your “ friends and acquaintance.”
No—I am too nice to engage, indiscriminately, with the professed votaries of Venus; and honour forbids me to
poach upon another man’s grounds. I B 3	am

am too virtuous, indeed, .Deshorough, to commit adultery; but I do not start 'at a little simple fornication.
Thus, you fee, I have no very brilliant hopes of what 7,call happiness, as I am not possessed of an ample fortune ; that is, an income Sufficient to gratify my own wishes, and the desires alSo of my female companion. Without a female companion I have no idea of felicity : and I assure you, had I a large estate at my command, I would marry to-morrow, whether the girl of my choice had a fixpence in her pocket or not: had I enough for us both, I should be extremely well Satisfied. The girl is ready—Were the fortune ready too—but as there is no proSpect of that., tell me no more of my happineSs. It is imposh-

After a tedious day, and a restleSs night, I sit down to tell you, with Sorrow to tell you, what discoveries I have made in mySelf: dss-B 4 ‘	coveries

e^^veries which I am almost ashamed to communicate; but I cannot, I do not desire to conceal them from you. I actually believe that I am in love —-- I have been horridly queer thefe last four and twenty hours—I cannot think what is the matter with me; but it is certainly So—You shall judge from the Symptoms which I am going to describe. In the first place, however, let. me give you a fketch of the charming fellow who has made Such a monstrous bustle in my mind — yet I assure you that his conversation has done more execution than his perSon.
I was at Ranelagh last night with Sir Thomas LaScelles, and his Sister Mrs. Woodyer. There never was Such a crowd ^ we could not get any Seats, but '	were

were forced to walk round and round till we were ready to drop.
Growing weary, at length I complained So loud, that two gentlemen darting out of a box, one of them advanced to me, and made me an offer of it in So gallant a manner, that I was doubly obliged to him for it; and I really stood So Ipng looking at him before I could find words to thank him, that I can give you a pretty exact description of his perSon. He was tall, and finely formed; his air was that of a man of fashion; his complexion was clear, and animated with a glow of health, with a manly chearfuIneSs not to be expressed. He had a pair of the most Seducing black eyes I ever beheld: his very fine hair was drest with a careless-neSs infinitely becoming: to conclude;

his elegant mouth, whenever he opened it, discovered the whitest and most even Set of teeth to be conceived. Such was the perfon of this charming fellow. With regard to his voice and his address, I cannot possibly do them justice with my pen.
" Well—we accepted his offer—I should 'rather fay I accepted of it, as it was directed only to me,'and took possession of the place he had quitted: my eager eyes, however, were brisldy employed in Search of him. Every now and then I Saw him, amidst the throng, talking to his < companion, on whoSe shoulder he leaned, with a vivacity perfectly enchanting. I was So lost indeed in my Search after him, and in looking at him when I did 'See him, that I hardly knew what I was
’about.	..	.

Happening to mifs my handkerchief, I rofe in order to hunt for it, and found it under my feet. I picked it up immediately, and put it into my pocket.
As Soon as I took it out at home, rumpled, a letter dropped out of it, signed Charles Frankland. It was addressed to a John Deshorough, ESq; in Clarges-street.
This letter contained Sentiments which delighted me exceedingly. It was full of Sensible and Spirited expreshons, and there Seemed to be a sincerity running through it, which made it doubly pleasing. It must certainly have been written, I think, by the agreeable fellow whom I had admired. I am by no means Sure, however, that it was written by him. There may have been twenty B 6	different

different men in that box during the evening ; but as I know not the names of -any of them, as I know not even the charming fellow’s name who gave me his place, I am altogether in the dark about this adventure. I can only fay with any certainty, that the man whole air and figure So much attracted my attention, looked just as if he eould have written every word in the letter I So unexpectedly brought home with me. Undoubtedly he did write it—I cannot be mistaken. Now the conclusion I draw iflrom it is, that Such a Sweet Sellow, ewith So excellent an understanding, and To pleasing a perSon, mujl necessarily make the woman whom he can love eompleatly happy : and, as I have a for-^tune Sufficient, I hope, to make him happy, if I can but keep it, as I am my own mistreSs, to confeSs the truth honestly,

Bell, I Sincerely wish myfelf that individual woman.
hfou will, probably, imagine that my head is quite turned, as I am So taken with a man whom I had never Seen before, and to whom I have never Spoken : but though I was, I will own, greatly struck with his figure and manner of ad-dreSs, I am far more pleaSed with his letter, in which he has. Seemingly, o-pened his whole heart to his friend. What an honest, undefigning heart the agreeable wretch has ! He is indeed a very wretch, for he is already in love, yet cannot afford to marry. But he will never be any thing to me, as he has declared he will never marry merely for money. I should not indeed chuSe to be looked upon only as an appendage to an estate: I must be loved as much
as

as I love, or I will never be a wife. To how great a degree I could love this wild fellow, I am almost afraid to alk myfelf. Wild he is as wind, but not wicked : now that just Suits me. After all, however, I cannot be certain that he wrote this letter, (which I have transcribed,^ and encloSed for your pe-rufal:) and were I Sure that he was the writer of it, how am I to get at him ? I may never fee him again, but I will make it my bufineSs to alk every body I meet with about a Mr. Frankland and a Mr. Deshorough.

LETTER III.
From the fame to the fame.
IW A S right. Bell: I thought I could not be mistaken: am I not exceedingly lucky to have got all my information So Soon ? However, I shall not, I fancy, be the happier for it. I fuppofe now you want to hear how it happened in a hurry : I will make haste therefore to tell you.
The morning after I wrote to you I called on Harriot Swymmer, in conSe-
quence
i6 The Disinterested Marriage,
quence of an appointment between us a week ago. I was never leSs difpoSed to visit her, but I went. I found her brother with her. They were talking of fome company he had met with at Ranelagh the very night I was there.
“Lord blefs me!” exclaimed I, with a violent abruptnefs, “did you “ See a Mr. Frankland
“ Certainly I did,” replied he; “Charles “ Frankland is one of my most inti-“ mate friends; but he was not of “ your party. Lady Lucy, that night.”
“ No;” anfwered I, colouring excessively, “ we are not acquainted ; but “ I received an accidental civility from “ a gentleman of that name, I believe;
“I am
The Disinterested Marriage. 27
“ I am not Sure, however. What Sort “ of a man is ,your Franklarid
“ Tall, well-made and handSome, “ with a brown complexion,” Said he; “ the honestest, best-natured fellow in “ the world.—Does this description “ Square with yours ?” continued he. Smiling: “ but we shall Soon See, for I y expect him here every moment.”
How my heart fluttered. Bell! I w'as ready to die with apprehensions: I longed to stay, and yet I was afraid lest I should be mistaken. However, I plucked up a little courage, and proceeded —• “The man I mean, Mr. “ Swymmer, is in love, I imagine.”
“ With your Ladyship ?” re plied he,,
Surveying me, archly.
'	“ Lord,
i8 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Lord, no—I am quite a stranger “ to him,” Said I, blushing again, like an awkward creature as I was—“ but”—
“Oh,— yes,—” anfwered he, recollecting himSelf, and happily overlooking my embarrassment, “ I believe he is in “ love with a MiSs Price : yet I do not “ think they will come together; there “ is not money enough between them: “ Charles is too generous to distreSs the “ woman whom he pretends to love.”
Excellent! —thought I — This must be my man : there are few like him.
Before I could ash any more questions, or make any more reflections, the very man, the Sweet fellow, of whom we had been talking, came in.
With
The Disinterested Marriage.
W”ith a gracefulnefs not to be described, he advanced towards Harriot: then, turning to me, he fell back a little, as if recollection had made him think Something more than a Sormal bow recjuired of him, and threw a Smile into his animated countenance, which added a tliouSand bewitching charms to features which were but too attractive before. .
I Smiled too, I believe: I certainly coloured, and looked like a fool, yet I was willing to fix him for an acquaintance at once, becauSe I did not know when 1 might fee him again. I cur-tesied therefore, as if I thought mySelf under obligations, and wished to make acknowledgments. I found myfelf strangely at a lofs—I was never more disconcerted in my life. At last, I Somehow contrived to mention Ranelagh;
and
id The Disinterested Marriage,
and then, turning to' him. Said, with all the good-humour I could call up in my face — “I believe. Sir,I was obliged to “ you for a feat Some nights ago : it was-“ a most Seafonable relief, as I was ne-“ ver more weary in my life.”
“ I am inexpressibly happy, Madam,”^ replied he, with a charming voice, and a striking Satisfaction in his looks, “ in having been of any Service to you.”
This little Speech considerably increaSed my prepossessions in his favour. In short. Bell, he absolutely enchanted me*, and I believe I was So far taken in as not to be' able to diSguife the pleaSure 1 felt in being So near him ; though I do assure you I strove to conceal it. Whether Swymmer Saw it I cannot tell, but he acted as
if
The Disinterested Marriage. 21-
if he had a mind to keep us together, by proposing a visit to Christie’s.
I made no objection tp his propoSal. I should have gone, I fancy, to the end of the world with fuch company.
Harriot immediately declared her ap--probation of her brother’s Scheme, and we let out, Frankland and I entered very freely into conversation. What a fine understanding he has! How ex-.quisite is his Sensibility ! how delicate is his taste ! In short. Bell, this is the man.—But he is in love with another woman—However, not being quite Sure that he had wrote the letter which I So much admired, I reSolved to have my curiosity gratified.
T aking
22 The Disinterested Marriage.
Taking it out of my pocket — “I “ fancy. Sir,” Said I, “ you are con-“ cerned in this letter. I am strongly “ inclined to believe indeed that you y wrote it.”—putting it into his hand.
Take notice. Bell, I had Secured another copy. What an infinite deal of pains have I taken about this man already ! I wish he ever repays me: though, in my opinion, he well deServes all my Solicitude about him.
Taking the letter from me, he laughed, yet coloured a little, and looked rather confufed. — “ Good God ! ” exclaimed he, “ how could that blundering fellow “ Deshorough drop my Scrawl ^ — I am “ quite Sorry,” continued he, in a different tone, “ that your Ladyship had ‘V the trouble of picking it up: it was
“ not
The Disinterested Marriage. 23
“ not in the least worthy of your atten-‘‘ tion”—(thrusting it into his pocket.)
“ Indeed,” replied I, “ you do it not “ Sufficient justice : the letter is a very “ good letter : I will not pretend to Say “ that I have not read it, as it was ■“ open; and 1 am Sure it contains ex-“ oellent Sentiments.”
Your LadySbip does me unmersted “ honour,” Said he, with a reSpectful bow, casting down, at the Same time, ' his bewitching eyes : “ but I am actu-“ ally ashamed of your having Seen fuch “ poor matters.”
“ If that is all,” cried Swymmer, laughing, “ pry thee write a better epistle, “ to make Lady Lucy amends for that “ which has fallen under her inipection.”
“ I
24 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ I dare not take that liberty,” replied he, with a Scrutinizing look; to See, I thought, if he might or no.
“ You may, indeed,” anfwered L Smiling : “I shall not be at all Sorry to “ have Such a correlpondent.”
I was now afraid I had Said too much: I really wondered at myfelf, and blushed: yes, honestly blushed at my own af-furance.
He looked, and bowed again—Surely he will not write. If he writes I shall be lost. He is a divine creature. 1 could hardly, I own, prevail on mySelf to go while he staid. At last, however, fearful of being pronounced quite intoxicated with him, I rOfe,
He
The Disinterested Marriage. 25
He followed me, and put me into my chair: and here, I fuppofe, our acquaintance will end; fori cannot, decently, make any farther advances, and he did not Solicit another interview.
How heavy my heart is! How dull is my life! To make the affair worSe, a card is just arrived from Lord Grashng-ton. I cannot possibly think of Nm, after this insinuating, captivating Fraitk-land.
Don’t you imagine my head is quite turned ? Mad or Sober, however, I am still

Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborough.
WH A T a careleSs, idle, good-for-nothing rogue you are, to go and drop my letter at Ranelagh, and makO me, by So doing, look like an aSs, before the most agreeable creature in the univerSe, who picked it up ; a Lady Lucy Menell ?
Lady Lucy was the very woman whom I took particular notice of that night: the very woman to whom, as she appeared to be quite tired with her cir-t:ular walks, we resigned our box. Do you not recollect her ? You cannot. Surely, have forgotten her. She was tall and elegant; not absolutely a beauty, but Something more : she had one of
thoSe
The Disinterested Marriage. 27
thoSe faces which are full of expression and Sensibility : full either of a laughable vivacity, or an enchanting, irresistible languor. This is the woman who took up my letter, and who has made not a few Speeches to me about it: Speeches of a very intoxicating nature, I assure you: they have excited in me fome vain. Some Saucy SenSations. Indeed Jack, however, I wish you had not dropped this filly letter, for it has thrown me into the way of a woman whom I shall probably like better than I ought. 1 had but just, you know, been telling you in it, that I was miserable on account of the Sex; not with a woman, but for want of one. An almost angelic creature is now fallen in my way : to look at only : were I to offer at a contafl with her, she would, I imagine. Soon give me reafon to repent of my C 2	rash-

rashneSs. I will not, therefore, come in her fight. She looks fweetly, I confeSs, and Ipeaks fairly too, at preSent; yet, should I perSevere in keeping up the acquaintance I have made with her, I should Soon expect to See a change in her. I cannot, indeed, expect her, with Such a Superiority in point of rank and fortune, to think in a favourable mannerof me. It will, consequently, be more prudent in me to think no more of her: for admitting any condescensions on her side in my favour, 1 shall, by availing mySelf of them, be fuppofed, and not unjustly, to act under the insluence of lucrative considerations. No—I am much too proud to be a petticoat pensioner. Once again. Jack, I wish you had not dropped my letter.
Yours,

Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
IT is as I Said. Frankland and I have never met since, though I have been warmly in purSuit of him from place to place. I just faw him, flying, one morning into the Park^ and was really far gone enough to have stopped him : but though I Said “ Your lervant. Sir,” and looked as if I wished he would have Spoken to me, the inSenSible creature only took off his hat. Smiled, and hurried . away from me. To be Sure he does not like me. Did he feel the Smallest desire to be acquainted, he would not, I imagine. Scamper away from me as if I was infected with the plague.—Well! I cannot help it: I should, however, be C 3	ex-

extremely glad to fee, and be acquainted, with this Mifs Price ; and, now I think of it, I will call upon Harriot Swymmer; she, perhaps, can tell me every thing I want to know. When I come back I will finish my letter.
In Continuation.
I hurried to Swymmer, and all the way I went, fancied that she would not be at home; but I was mistaken. She was both at home, and alone. I was, however, at a loSs to begin my enquiry, being apprehensive of her fuf-fecting Something. I wanted to make a siandSome introduction, but I could not bring it out cleverly. At last I laid a trap for the gratification of my curiosity, with a good round one.—You know what I mean. I was Sorry afterwards, indeed,
as
The Disinterested Marriage.' 31
as it did me no fort of Service. “ Mr. “ Frankland,” Said I, “ is going to be “ married, I hear.”
“ Is he?” replied Harriot, without taking her eyes from her tambour ; “ to “ whom?” “To a Mifs Price,” an-Swered I; “ though I do not know any “ thing about her.” “ Did you ever “ See her ? ” cried she, coolly—and then turned the conversation to a quite different Subject.
Eager to reSume tl»i2tdn which I was So much interested mySelf, I thus proceeded—“ I want to fee this MiSs Price ; y I wonder whether she is pretty.”
“I know nothing about her,” Said - Harriot, with rather a fretful tone, as if she was tired of hearing of her.
C 4	“I
32 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ I am Sure Somebody mentioned her “ in this houSe,” replied I.
“ My brother, 1 SuppoSe—He knows “ her.”
“ Where is your brother
“ Out of town.”
“ Pshaw!” anfwered I, peevishly—-I was actually in a pet.
Just when I was thinking of taking leave, who should come in but Frankland himSelf ?
“ Is Mr. Swymmer at home, Ma-“ dami ?” Said hetoHarriot. Then, bowing to me, he added, ‘‘ Your Ladyship’s “ most obedient.”
My
The Disinterested Marriage^ 33
My heart began to thump strangely: at first I thought to look cool, in order to shew that I refented his indifference: but should I not, by Such a behaviour, have shewn him alSo that I was hurt by it ?—I acted in another manner : with a Smile I told him, that I was come to enquire after a Lady of his acc^uaintance, a MiSs Price.
“ She is a most agreeable girl,” faid he, with a frankneSs that charmed me, “ Your Ladyship would, I believe, be “ pleaSed with her.”
“ Very probably,” replied I: “ pray “ tell me, Mr. Frankland, what fort of “ a perSon has she ?”
“ She is tall and slender, yet genteelly “• made,” anSwered he:	she is fair;
C 5	_	“ she
34 The Disinterested Marriage.
she has pretty little features, and the “ rofy blushes in her cheeks animate her
whole appearance.”
What a' Sweet description. Bell! I was half in love with the girl, mySelf, or rather with the picture he had drawn, of her.
“ Vastly agreeable, indeed,” Said I: “ and how is her mind—if you, as a “ man, pay any regard to that ?
“ I certainly do, Madatn—A woman “ without a mind is, in my opinion, ex-“ tremely defective, brilliant as her perSo-‘ nal attractions may be—^Patty Price has “ a very good improved understanding ; “ and a gentle, affectionate dilpoSition, “ She is as mild as the western breeze:
“ she

%
“ she has no pride, no vanity, no affec-“ ration.”
“ A faultleSs character, I fuppofe ! ” cried I, interrupting him, out of patience to hear him fo extravagant in her praiSe, though I hated mySelf, at the Same time, for being So ridiculous — and Sat down discontented, without Speaking another word.
During my Silence Frankland chatted with Harriot, and took not any notice of me till Swymmer appeared, who told us that every body was going to the Pan-toccini, and ashed us if we would be of the party—looking at Frankland and me—“ What party ?” faid Harriot.
“ Sir William Sadler, Lady Sadler, y and MiSs—Come, Lady Lucy,” add-C 6	ed
3si The Disinterested Marriage;
ed he — “ will you join us .?—and you, “ Frankland,” continued he, “ will “ make one, I hope.”
I consented immediately: there was nothing I liked better; but my gentleman began to shy off, by faying that he believed he had an engagement that evening.
I was almost mad at the thoughts of losing fo fine an opportunity. “ Nay “ now,” Said I to him, with a freedom on which I have since reslected with fome wonder, “ you shall not Serve us So”— Then, calling Harriot to my assistance, I added—“ Let us makB him gp with us, “ MiSs Swymmer.”
“ Ay,” replied she, with the Same provoking non-ihalance which she had

discovered all the mOrning — “ Do you “ make him ; I am fo puzzled with my « silk—”
“ Do you hear. SirSaid I, with a Smile, “ I am to make you do what we “ would have you.”
With a look which would have charmed infenjibility. herSelf, he replied, “ I am “ all obedience to ycur will. Madam ; I “ am quite at your dsspoSal.”
“ I take you at your word,” anSwered I, laughing, “ and shall put mySelf “ under your protection, for the even-« ing.”
He replied, while his eyes Sparkled with pleasure, “ You do me a great “ deal of honour, Madam.”

I then begged him to Set me down, and to permit me to thank him for having been fo Serviceable to me.
He complied, and not unwillingly, I thought.—We had chatted above an hour before 1 in the least considered how the time passed away.—He then, pulling out his watch, aSked pardon for his intrusion fo late in the evening, and flew out of the houfe before I could tell whether I should have acted right or wrong by inviting him to eat a bit of Supper

LETTER VI.
Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborough.
I Am drawn into a pretty Scrape, by your having dropped that letter: for I will fay that my letter to you, picked up at Ranelagh, was the foundation of my acquaintance with this enchanting woman, who has actually afforded me fo much pleaSure, that she has prevented me from being pleaSed with any other woman.
I met Lady Lucy again at Swym-mer’s. We have made a downright friendship with each other; but our attachment—there is a malicious devil in the way—can never come to any thing more.
She
44 The Dijinterested Marriage.
She has hurt her ancle ; I go and fit with her every day, for two or three Fours together: we chat, laugh, play and sing: by the by, she sings like an angel.—When I called the Second day of her confinement, I Saw an organ in the room; there was a guittar too. Some music-books lay upon the table, and I desired her not to let the instruments remain unemployed.
“ It is imposhble for me to walk to the organ without help,” faid she; “ but, “ now I think of it, do you sit down to “ the organ, and I will take, up the “ guittar.”
“ How do you know that I can play ?’* faid I.

“ Your eyes,” anSwered she, with much significance in her own, “ your
eyes are tell-tales, Frankland ; fit “ down, therefore, and let me hear no “ excuSes.”
“ Have they only told you that I am “ mufical ? have they communicated “ no intelligence more interesting ?” thought I, looking earnestly at her, while I began to touch the keys.
“ Oh! that is quite ravishing,” cried shCi “do, play it again.”
“ And fo you are, to madneSs” — thought I—but take notice, Deshorough,
I Spoke not a word:. the truth is, I -ought not to indulge the Smallest idea concerning this fine lively creature.

45 The Disinterested Marriage.
Yesterday I questioned Swymmer very clofely about her.—Her father, the late
Earl of-----, upon losing a large Sum to
Lord Grassington at play., and upon his forgiving the debt, which he was unable to discharge, offered him the refuSal of his daughter: his Lordship, however, whofe father was then alive, and at his estate in Ireland, being Sent for by him, as he was feized with a dangerous disorder, and wished earnestly to See him before he died. Set out directly, without Seeing Lady Lucy, who was at that time with an aunt of hers in Yorkshire. The Earl dying Soon after Lord Graf-Sington, left his preSent Lordship at liberty to marry his daughter. If Jhe re-fuSes to fulfil her father’s promiSe, in caSe of its being claimed, she is to forfeit a great part of her fortune. From that time to this. Lord Grassington has
been
< •
The Disinterested Marriage. 47*
been detained in Ireland by busineSs, and by a Severe fit of illneSs: he is just recovered, and has wrote to the Lady in the character of a claimant. Her answer to his letter was a very doubtful one. She hourly expects to hear of the death of the only Son of her father’s brother, who has been, for Some time, in a decline, and is now at Montpellier by the advice of his physicians.—In this situation are her affairs at preSent; and if you think I shall not Sufficiently embar-raSs mySelf by a tender attachment to Such a woman, you must be very ignorant indeed. I can only add, that I have all the reaSon in the world to believe she likes me, but she likes me, perhaps, only for my company, pcur tuer le terns. Admitting, however, I dare flatter mySelf that her prepossessions ’ in my favour should increafe; admitting

she should have a Serious inclination for me, can I Suppofe that she will ever carry her partiality fo far, as to give up her fortune for me Besides, circumstanced as she is, I cannot prefume to addreSs her; I cannot, with the least propriety, tell her that I love her, when I know that she is partly engaged to Lord Grassington. If this cousin, indeed, dies, she will be mistrefs of afi independent fortune; but then if I make my addresses to her after his death, I shall appear to have waited for it. I cannot bear to be thought So mercenary a devil, especially by Such a woman as this is, Deshorough : no, I had better take my leave cf her at once ; but theTe is Something So faScinating in every thing she Says and does, that I look upon a Separation from her, almost like the Separation of my Soul from my body.—She is

I think I will stay away, and try.

I was called away from writing about^ the Sweet fellow, to fee him, to listen to him, to talk with him.

Bell ? However, it is not come to that yet; though I could Scarce keep mySelf from reproaching hinr, for having staid away So many days.
He began his apology in the following words: — “ After having deprived my-“ Self of the happineSs of Seeing you.

•“ You may, Mr. Frankland; I grant “ your request.”—prefenting my hand to him at the fame time. He pressed it to his lips with Such violence, that 1 cried out, half in jest, half in earnest—
“ Oh ! my hand, my hand ! ”
“ Surely,” replied he, with a Smile,
“ I have not hurt you ; if I have, I will “ heal the wound immediately—Let me “ See it,”" added he, going to take it again.
“ No indeed,” anSwered I, turning it off with a laugh, “ I shall not trust “ you any more : you are too impe-y tuous.”

Just at that moment Thomas opened the.door, and Lord Grassington came in.
I started; I changed colour I am Sure. I wished, indeed, he had been a million of miles off.
Frankland Sat down, and discovered nothing of a lover-like appearance; my JLord, however, eyed him, I thought, in a particular manner; and he, I imagine, observed his Scrutinizing looks; for he presently roSe, and, with an eaSy air, wished me a good morning.
“ You are not going, Mr. Frankland ! ” faid I—“you have been-here but a very

Bell, which,, while you cannot find fault with it,, keeps you at a distance, he appeared both disappointed iand difconcerted,
Frankland still kept his place: my. Lord,, therefore, finding no hopes of hik moving, with a look of contempt ax him,' a look of ill-nature and refent-ment at me, retired..
No Sooner was he gone, than Frank- 1 land opened his mouth to ipeak; but,

before he could articulate a Syllable, two formal prudes came in, to make a morning-visit : they were followed, I dare Say, by two-and-twenty: that, as fast as one retreated, another advanced : and there was Such a quick Succession during the whole morning, that I had hardly time to get dressed by dinner. F^rankland, at last, feeing no hopes of a private conversation with me, took his leave.
After dinner Lord Grassington Sent in his name: I had, however, previously given orders to be denied to him.

I pretended, however, to be apprehensive of having offended her, on purpofe to hear her make fome kind concession in my favour, by way of^Sealing my pardon; and I was fo Successful, that I gained the animating promiSe of her friendship.— Charming creature ! — I might have,, perhaps, arrived at Something still more desirable, had we not been interrupted by that bane to my happineSs, the detestable Lord Grashngton, who purSues my Lucy, only with a view of possessing her fortune, or rather, by way of paying himSelf the debt her father contracted with him, and which has ex-poSed the amiable girl to the Severe necessity of giving her hand without her heart. However, if I can form any judgment from her behaviour, she will J

still refuSe him: if my conjectures are right, and if Mr. Menell recovers, no^ thing shall hinder me from offering my little all to her. The moment she accepts of it, I will draw a plan of rural felk city,. Jack, Sufficiently pleaSurable to make monarchs burst with envy: for though my pittance is but Small, and will be leSs when it is shared with a woman of quality, yet, if that woman sincerely and fondly loves me, she will be happier with me than with the richest peer in England. If, indeed, Mr. Me>- _ nell dies, I shall not think of ashing Lady Lucy to bestow the fortune which will then be in her possession upon me. Besides, I am too proud to be dependant, even on the woman I love. I have given her reaSon enough to believe that I. can be extremely happy with her, and I I think I am Sure of her friendship,
Thus^ ^ '

Thus we are in a fair way to be better acquainted, if fortune should favour our mutual hopes. Sometimes I fancy that she wishes, as much as I do mySelf, that there was no bar to our union : yet I am a coxcomb to fancy So, for she never gave me the slightest encouragement to fuppofe she had any Serious thoughts of me. Why must I imagine that a woman is in love with nte, becauSe she is commonly civil to me? — But I am certainly in love with her, and, in conSequence of my tender passion, shall become intolerably vain.

to a woman with whom he is not more acquainted than I am with Lord GraS-sington, and, perhaps, likes her no better; yet I do not fee how he can get off, as she was left by her father to the care of his, who Solemnly promiSed that his Son should marry her, though it is highly probable that your Ladyship is the object of his choice but as he has never mentioned his prepossessions in your favour to you, I think it abfo-Jutely necessary to acquaint you with them. I take this opportunity, therefore, To let you know what you are to expect; that is, no Small opposition from MiSs Plastow, as the diSputed lover * happens to be very agreeable.
Now for a few words about my own <
affairs,	^
I am :
The Disinterested Marriage. 75
I am determined, since Lord Grassington will persist in following me, to talk very freely to him upon the fubject in question, and to tell him, that as it is impossible for me to love him, it will be much happier for him, as well as for me, to give over all thoughts of me ; I shall inform him that it will be both cruel and unjust to deprive me of more of my fortune than will anSwer the Sum which my father lost to the late Lord Grassington ; I shall alSo inform him, that I am ready to make a handSome addition to it, in consideration for his compromising the affair. If this mode of proceeding proves unsatisfactory to him, I am refolved to forfeit the whole, rather than marry a man who can take fo ungenerous an advantage of my father’s will. In this manner I intend to obtain my freedom; and when I have got it, I E 2	shall

shall think it incumbent on me to make much of it : for, should I loSe my liberty a Second time, 1 shall loSe it for ever. Besides, though Frankland has the most love-like looks and behaviour I ever obServed in any man, he Seems to be as little inclined to a Serious engagement with me, as I am for entering into a connection for Lord Grassington. He laughs, and chats, and sings and plays with me; but I am not, therefore, to play the fool for life. We may like each other extremely well for a few hours, but should be, perhaps, horridly mortisied, were we tied together forever and aye.—It is plain, however,	(
by the letter, which contained the real	i
Sentiments of his heart, and which must have been written with unquestionable sincerity, as it was designed only for the inspection of a particular friend, that	'

he purpoSed to marry when he could meet with a woman Suitable to him: and I cannot help thinking but that he fancies me to be Such a woman in point of fortune ; as my fortune, were it quite at my own difpoSal, must be a larger one than a man, with only five hundred a year, can reaSonably expect. This very fortune therefore, my dear, may be the greatest charm, for aught I know, in his eyes. Were I Sure that he is actuated by mercenary motives, I would never See.him, never listen to him again; He shall be informed of the true state of my affairs ; and if, whem I appear to have little or nothing, he prefers me to all other women, I may, I think, conclude, that he is as worthy, as disinterested a fellow, as ever lived : but then, should I take advantage of Such uncommon generosity of Sentiment ?

Lord Grassington Surveyed us both with looks which boded us no good ; and thoSe which he darted at me were particularly malignant; but as Lady Lucy had fent for me, I thought I had no bufineSs to stir, and that my retreat would denote a pusillanimity. Sufficient to render me deSpicable in the eyes of her whom alone I wished to pleaSe. Besides, had she not just before told me, that she could not think of any other man, till her detestable engagement with Lord Grassington was at an end ? And was not that declaration enough to make me stay—ay, and to hope too ? — How my heart bounds at the delightful idea ! And yet, to what purpofe do I indulge it, if I cannot prudently make an offer to a woman of her quality with my little income: if it is too Small for a wife in a private way,

how insufficient must it be for the gen--teel Support of a wife of any rank ! It will hardly keep, a woman of fashion in clean linnen.

I am not Sure, indeed,. that this dear creature would re-fufe compliance v:ith my wishes. I fometimes fancy that. I am totally an object of indifference in her eyes. If she really loves me—what a transporting thought 1—will she not conform to my desires ? Will she not even be happy with me, and my little, rather than give her hand to a man for whom she feels no affection ?

No—that will never do. In short, the more I think about this disagreeable affair, the more I am perplexed and disconcerted : I will therefore turn my thoughts another way: and yet I may as Soon ceaSe to exist, as to Sorget this charming woman.

Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
WELL, my dear; I told Frankland how disagreeably I am circumstanced. He made no anSwer to the diScloSure of my Situation : he could not indeed get an opportunity to return a reply; for the odious man came in, and prevented every thing. Frankland alSo, by staying, prevented me from carrying the design I had formed into execution.; and yet, as I had fent for him, I could not expect his Speedy departure.
You are SurpriSed, I imagine, at my having Sent for Frankland—I am Surprised, indeed, mySelf: the truth is, he I

had not been near me for Several days, and 1 became So restleSs, So uneaSy, that I could not help diSpatching a meS-fage to him. He came, and Said a thousand civil things, more civil than he had yet uttered; which drew Some Srom me in return. In short, we Seemed to be mutually pleaSed with each other. While we were in the midst of a very interesting tete-a-tete. Lord Grashngton broke in upon us, and Spoilt all. X confeSs I was disappointed.
In Continuation.	^
I have had Such an inundation of company since I laid down my pen, that I have not been able to find a Single moment to finish my letter—And of what can I now write about, except my Situation with Frankland ?
I Seized
92 The Disinterested Marriage!
I Seized the first opportunity in my power to inform Lord Grassington, that as I could never love him, I positively never would marry him. In short, 1 faid every thing I had intended to Say to him, but I miight as well have talked to the floor : I was as far as ever from the point I had in view; for he told me that he never would give me up, and that the wealth of worlds could not make him the slightest reparation for the loSs of me : —concluding with an assurance, that he would w^ait my time, with all the patience he was master of.
I was horridly provoked at this anSwer, and replied, — “ Rather than marry you, “ my Lord, with whom I have no “ proSpect of being happy, I will for-“ feit every penny of my fortune.-— “ You may act therefore as you pleaSe— y you may take it, or relinquish it, just
“ as
The Disinterested Marriage. 93
“ as your inclination determines your decision,”
Finding that I was in earnest, he endeavoured to Sooth me into a good humour with him, and to wind me to hi« purpoSe; but I was inflexible; and acquainted him with my reSolution not to Say any more upon the Subject; adding, that as I had not made that reSolution in a hurry, nothing should induce me to change it. Perceiving therefore that he could neither make me talk upon that fubject, nor upon any other, he left .the room, quite out of temper. He went away extremely dissatisfied, and I remained still more So ; for I could not well Send for Frankland just at that time: I should shave appeared, by So doing, desirous of his making me an offer, when 1 had been rejected by every

body. I shallj certainly loSe all my lovers, upon this reverSe of fortune; but I am determined not to marry the man whom I do not love. I need not, indeed, put myfelf into a fright, I believe; taking it for granted, that no man will think of marrying me. Lord Grassington excepted. However, tho* I did not know how, in this humiliating state, to See Frankland, I wished to receive a visit from him.
He came at last—I was Serious and disconcerted; yet I afked him where he had been during So long an abSence. Fie replied, that he had been in a very ^ joyleSs condition from the time he had left me — “If I could have found joy,” continued he, “ in any other place, I “ should not have troubled you with “ my company here again.”

The Disinterested Marriage. 95
“ I am obliged to you,” replied I, Smiling ; “ I find you came only for your “ own pleafure, and not for mine.”
“ Indeed you wrong me,*’ anSwered he: “ it is not in my power to contribute “ to your pleaSure: and as mine consists “ chiesly in Seeing you, and hearing you, “ it is very natural for me to come “ after it.”
I felt my face glow while he talked in this manner, as he had fixed his eyes upon me; I, therefore, was obliged to throw mine down ; the necessity of fuch a proceeding made me sigh, though very Softly.
“ You are not happy. Lady Lucy,” faid he; “ Something hangs upon your “ mind to-day : will you not trust me
“ with

“ with it ? The communication of “ your Sentiments may, possibly, relieve “ your mind.”
“ Nothing will relieve my mind,” anSwered I, “ but my Lord Grassing-“ ton’s relinquiOiing his claim both to “ me and my fortune,; and that event, “ I fear, is not to be expected.”
“ There may be other ways found “ out, I imagine,” Said he, “ to restore “ your mind to its former tranquility— “ Had I an estate worth your Lady-“ ship’s acceptance, I should not hesi-
tate a moment to lay it at your feet: “ and. Small as mine is, if you will “ condeScend to receive it, it is yours.”
I was nc- a little furpriSed at this offer, and at the abruptnefs of it. I could
not
The Disinterested Marriage, 97
not tell how to think it was a Serious one, though it was delivered in a manner Sufficient to make me think him quite in earnest. Not having it in my power to be in earnest mySelf, I knew not what better to fay, than to tell him that he was in a very merry humour, or he would not have been able- to rally in Such a manner, upon the most Serious of all Subjects.
He replied, in anSwer, that he was extremely Serious, and called upon heaven, in the most Solemn language, to witneSs the truth of what he had uttered; adding,'shat he had been charmed with me from my very first acquaintance ; that nothing but an inequality of fortune had prevented his addressing me with all the energy with which his Soul was filled every time he Saw me; and

that, as we were how brought nearer to a level with each other (confessing, however, there was still great preSumption in the attempt) he had dared to offer himSelf, and all he could call his, to my acceptance.
I heard him out, but was incapable of making any reply : I stood quite embarrassed, without venturing to look up, much leSs to Speak to him.
While I was in this embarrassed state, he Seized my hand, and pressing it to his lips. Said, “ Can you pardon me,
“ Lady Lucy, for Such an incoherent , “ addreSs ? Where our hearts are Sen-“ Sibly affected, it is not in our power “ to communicate our feelings in the

How modest ! What a pretty apd*-logy ! It affected me strangely, and gave me a proper hint for an anSwer, which I at last, but not without Some difficulty, returned, as I really cOiild not bear (I told him So) the thoughts of accepting his very genteel offer, till I was in a Situation not to want it.
“ Why then,” replied he, “ it will “ be worth just nothing at all: but “ you will not, cannot refuSe me; you “ mufi permit me, by the whole Services “ oS my life, to endeavour, at least, to “ contribute to the happineSs of yours^

He looked most piteously, and faid, it was very hard to prohibit them both; adding, in a melancholy tone — “ What “ have I done, to draw upon mySelf “ fuch a cruel Sentence B ”

LETTER XV.
Mr. pRANicLAND to Mr. Desborough.
I HAVE actually had the assurance to offer myfelf to Lady Lucy; but I did not venture to make it till I found that she was rather embarrassed about her refusing Lord Grashngton, with regard to her fortune. My estate, you know, is very Small; I wish it was
larger.

larger, entirely for her fake; for the SmallneSs prevents her from accepting of it. She loves me indeed too well to accept of it. This declaration may perhaps, at first fight, have the air of a paradox, but it is neverthelefs a true one. I would not have made my offer, had I not been certain that her fortune was on the point of being diminished; and Jhe would not have rejected it, had she been Sure that there were no preSent hopes of its being increaSed: yet she frankly confessed that it was in my power alone to make her happy, though she would not hear any more upon the fubject at that time: she strictly forbade me, indeed, to revive it in afuture conversation. I acquieSced at the moment, but I shall endeavour to Seize the first opportunity to perSuade her to conSent to making ouf-
Selves

Selves mutually happy, by the doSest of all human connections. -
When I went home, after my last interview with Lady Lucy, I found a card from Sir William and Lady MiSe-nor, to request me to be of their party
to VauxhalL
Having no engagement upon my hands, I attended them. The elegant Mrs. Lauder was with them: she is just returned from Ireland, her year of mourning being expired. She is reckoned a first-rate beauty, and is, really, very handSome; yet there is a delicacy, a taste about her, still more attractive than her personal charms. She is young, and, does not want Senie ; she has only a little kind of hauteur in her look, voice and manner, which hinders her from
being
The Disinterested Marriage. 113
being So agreeable as she would otherwise be. She did me the honour, however, to treat me with particular attention, and even condeScended to take more notice of me than of any of the numerous train of men who followed her, admiring,, or pretending to admire her. Had my heart been quite at liberty, I might have been coxcomb enough to imagine she had taken a fancy to me ; but it is too much attached to Lady Lucy, to be*deeply affected by any other object. I was, however, very ashduous, I could not help being assiduous about Mrs. Lauder, while she was of the party.
In the midst of a long whiSper, during which she conveyed to my listening ears a pretty piece of Secret history, relating to a couple who had, from their first entrance, engaged our attention. Lady
Lucy
214 Disinterested Marriage,
Lucy made her appearance in the gar-, den, with the Swymmers, and Lord Grassington.
I was, I confeSs,. quite Sorry to be fo tngaged when fhe appeared, as I earnestly wished tp join her party.
On my (lipping away to tell her how it was, my widow, catching hold of m-y arm. Said, ^ “ Where are you running,
“ Mr. Frankland ? You shall not leave “ us indeed.’*

“ I am only going to fpeak to shme “ friends,” replied 1, “ who are just “ come in.**
Pshaw—but you must not go; we

However,

The Disinterested Marriage. ii5
However, 1 broke from her, and slew to Lady Lucy, who received me, I thought, with an unuSual statelineSs; though I did not oblerve that she took any more notice of his Lordship than she did of me.
“ How happy am I to meet you to-night!” faid I: “ what an iinex-pected pleaSure i Had I but known “ of your being here, I would have kept mySelf entirely difengaged,”
“ That would not have b^en at all “ necessary,” anfwered she, gravely, as I alSo am with a party.’*
“ But with a party whom I might be “ permitted to join, perhaps, were I “ alone.’*
“ Yes,'
rr(5 TheDisinterested Marriage.
“ Yes,” replied she: “ but as you “ are not,, you had better go back to your firiends” — laying a particular emphasis on the word friendsV
“ My best, my dearest, friend,” fai4 I, fpeaking low to her, “ is here.”
She fmiled, but faintly,.! thought, and shook her head. Soon afterwards the bright, the blooming widow, as if impatient for my return, failed clofely by us, and cast at me a most significant ' look r a look which drew a sigh from my Lucy, who viewed us both with a fcrutinizing attention : — “ Go,” faid she, pushing me gently: “ you are “ wanted.”
“ I do not wish to go,” replied I, “ un-“ lest you forbid me to stay where I am.”
“ I

. “ I shall not interfere in fo nice a “ businefs,” faid she—“ As you came “ with company, you ought to remain “ with them : I should be angry myfelf “ upon fuch an occasion, if I was left.”
“ I shall never incur your anger in “ .that manner,” anfwered I, quite charmed with her whole behaviour, which had a mixture of the tender and the jeakus in it, yet they were both kept .down by her politenefs and good fenfe—• I eould not brin» myfelf to leave her: I remained clofe by her side, regardlesi of Lord Graffmgton, whom I had entirely distanced. I had no opportunity of faying much, as the crowd was continually increasing; but to prevent her being incommoded, I put my arm round her, by way of defence.
T liming \
ii8 The Disinterested Marriage.
Turning her fweet eyes towards me, with a delicious languor in them, she faid, — “ Are you not gone- yet ?”
“ No,” replied I; “ you fee I cannot “ tear myfelf from you.”
She feemed pleafed with my unwii- • lingnefs to leave her; she almost leant against me, while I fupported her with rapture. There was a fort of corre-fpondence between us two, with which every body about us was totally unacquainted.
While I was enjoying more real de-" light than I had ever experienced before, a message came from Sir William, Lady MiSenor, and Mrs. Lauder, to defire me to return to them.
This
The Disinterested Marriage. 119
This message roufed me from my ssream of happinefs.
“ You muJi go to them nowP faid Lady Lucy, looking relufiance,
“ Only shr to-night,” — replied I, pressing her hand : ** in the morning I ■“ will sly to you again.
A thoufand tender things were discernible in her countenance—1 then left her, but not without the utmost regret, to Lord Grassington.
When I returned to my company, they all rallied me, and chid me pretty Smartly, for having deSerted them, and insisted upon my confining mylelf to them for the rest of the evening; during which the fair widow played all

her arts to attract my attention. She laughed, she languished, she difcovered every charm she was possessed of to the greatest advantage; she- fung too, at last, at the request of Lady Mifenor, and, in a very sine style, I could not but do ample justice to her melodious tones, and to her judicious management of them : you know I am fond of music almost to extravagance—-Here she triumphed : she thought she had, at length, gained a conquest over me.
When she was in the midst of her exultation, however, I recollected the elegant strains which I had heard from Lady Lucy’s lips, and that recollection brought her strongly before fiang’s <ye, arrayed in all her dazzling beauties. No longer were my looks directed to the feducing Lauder; they wandered in
fearch
The Disinterested Marriage. 12 i
fearch of the foie mistrefs of my affec-. tions: but Jhe, I believe, quitted the place fome time before our party thought of returning home.
When we feparated, Mrs. Lauder insisted upon my visiting her.
I bowed, but made no promife which I did not intend to perform.
The next morning I hurried to Lady Lucy: she was not up: she was not very well, her woman told me.
I went home difappointed, and chagrined—By the anxiety I felt at her in-difposition, I felt how much I loved her.

Thinking she would rife before dinner, if she was not very ill, I went again to her houfe. She was not yet ready to fee company.
When I returned home I found a card from Sir William Mifenor, desiring my company to dinner. My disturbed ■mind was not fufficiently eompofed to enable me to mix with any body.^—I wished to be alone, and, therefore, dispatched an apology.
A Sealed note was now brought to me from Sir William. In that he So earnestly pressed me to an interview with him, if only for a quarter of an hour, that I repaired . to him immediately, as T would not be hindered from calling at , Lady Lucy’s in the evening.
When
The Disinterested Marriage. 123
When I came to Sir William, he told me my perfon and behaviour had made fo great an impression upon Mrs. Lauder, that he was fure I might have her for ashing — “ She is handfome, you fee, “ and young: she is not ill-tempered, “ and has a clear two thoufand a year “ jointure, with twenty thoufand pounds “ in her pocket.”
i
“ Had she millions, I could not think “ of marrying a woman whom I did “ not love,” replied I.
“ Not love fuch a woman as Mrs. “ Lauder!” faid he, hastily: “furely “ you must be very nice indeed. — A “ woman whcfe perfon is as faultLfs as “ her conduct is irreproachable.—I wish, “ Frankland, I was of your age, and “ in your place, for her fake.”

I told him in reply, that I should always think myfelf obliged to him for his .friendly intention, though it was not in my power to avail myfelf of it; adding, that I was abfolutely engaged, and on no account could meet .Mrs. Lauder.
« Why

He now teafes me about giving him leave to correfpond with me during his tedious alfence, as he calls it. I wish I may not think it fo as well as he; but I had better bear it at first with a good grace, as it will be an evil—if it can be properly called an evil —not of the incurable kind. It is not very likely, I imagine,, that Lord Ash^ burne should be able to prevail on MiSs Plastow to resign him : it is much more probable that he should, by his appear^ ance, and the elegance of his language, determine her more strongly never to G 6	part

In Continuation,
I have just this morning received yours. I admire your refolution; it will be quite as efficacious, I fancy, as Lord Ashbourne’s visit to Mifs Plastow.

Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborough.
OH ! Jack!—Had I but a million to deferve this charming, this uncommon woman ! Surely she is a very extraordinary character. She has a foul fuperior to her fex. No man in the world can be worthy of her. It was not poshble for me, during feveral days, to gain admittance ; though I called on her continually, she was never to be feen. At last, however, she went abroad ; and I learnt, by dint of bribery, from her wo-man, whither she was gone.—She was gone to people with whom I had no acquaintance : I, therefore, could not decently introduce myfelf; but I fauntered in the street till her coach came for her. With a few more golden arguments, I
prevailed

prevailed on her fellows to let me feat myielf in a corner of it, and wait her arrival. The flambeaus foon difcovered me.—“ Good God ! here’s a man in the “ coach I” faid she.— “ Blefs me, Mr. “ Frankland, how could you fright me fo ? pray come out.”
“ Indeed I cannot,” replied I, earnestly : “I have called above a dozen “ times at your door, on purpofe to “ fpeak to you, and could never meet “ with you. Since, then, I have been “ fo lucky at last, I beg I may be per-,	“ mitted to make ufe of the prefent fa-
“ vourable opportunity.”
She looked embarrassed, fweetly difconcerted, as if she did not know what to fay.
« Well
The Disinterested Marriage. 135
“ Well then,” cried she, at last, “ since it must be fo—John, go home.”
During our ride I acquaintedsher with all the anxiety and concern I had endured from the time of her denying her-felf to me; having been apprehensive that she might be exceedingly indif-pofed.
“ I was not at all indilpofed,” replied she, with hurried accents ; “ not at all, “ Sir: I have been very well.”
“ Why then, my dear Lady Lucy,” faid I, taking her hand, “ would you “ refufe to fee me ? What have I done “ to deferve fuch cruel treatment
“ Nothing at all,” anfwered she; “ I “ have no fault to sind with you.”
“ For
136 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ For heaven’s fake then do not, by “ refusing me the happinefs of your “ company, drive me to defpair.”
“ You must not talk to me in this “ manner, Mr. Frankland,” faid she:
“ we must no longer carry on an inti-“ macy which can only create mutual “ uneasinefs. You must attach yourSess “ entirely to Mrs. Lauder, who is a ■ “ very sine woman, and very capable “ of making the man she loves, happy.”
“ I do not understand you,” replied I; wondering not a little at her having heard of the favourable opinion entertained of me by tl?at Lady.
“ You will not understand me: but “ you muft know that when you are
under an engagement to one woman,
y you,

The Disinterested Marriage. 137 “ yon, certainly, ought not ta follow “ another.”
“ You really perplex me exceedingly, “ Lady Lucy,” anfwered I: “ to no wo-“ man in the world, but to yourfelf, have “ I any attachment; nor can I imagine “ how you came to think of Mrs. “ Lauder.’^
“ Mrs. Lauder,” faid she, “ perfectly “ fenfible of your merit, is alSo ex-“ tremely well qualified to make you “ happy: you will be mad, therefore, “ to neglect fo fair an opportunity: “ you will be cruel to her, and un-“ kind to yourfelfP
“ I am not of your opinion,” anfwered I. — “ Were I indeed to addrefs “ a Lady whom I do not like, I Jhould

certainly be very unkind to myfelf, “ and very cruel to herP
“ But why should you not like Mrs. “ Lauder I ” replied she, with great quicknefs; “ she is young, handfome, y and fond of you.”
“ Were she dying for me,” faid I, with as much quicknefs, “ I would not “ marry her'—I cannot marry her : my
whole heart—my foul is yours.”
“ Ah, Frankland ! — talk no more “ in this strain; we were never designed “ for each other. You must not think “ of me : I have nothing in my power “ to give you : Mrs. Lauder has an ” ample fortune, with an .enlarged « mind.”
“ Were

“ Were she a thoufand times hand-“ fomer than she is; were it possible “ for her to be more generous, I could “ not love her. — Let us therefore, I “ intreat you, talk no more about “ her.”
“ But indeed we will. — I shall talk “ of nothing elfe while we arc to-“ gether.’*
“ You could not have chofen a more
difagreeable fubject,” faid I; rather piqued at a behaviour which I thought most provokingly ill timed.
“ I will be silent then,” replied she— and fpoke not another word.
When the coach stopped, she bade , me a good night.
“ Not
I
T40 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Not yet,” my dear Lady Lucy,” faid I — “ I shall not leave you quite fo “ foon.” Accordingly, 1 ibllowed her into the houfe.
She fat down rather with a dejecteff, than a melancholy aSpect. Taking a feat near her, I strove, by every art I was master of, to engage her in a converfation on the fubject I most wished to enter upon ; but she remained a long time without fpeaking.-—At last she began to advance fo many arguments iii favour of my marriage with Mrs; Lauder, that I grew quite out of hu? mour, and freely told her that I was entirely mistaken in- her; that I had once flattered myfelf with being looked upon by her with fome degree of ten-dernefs ; adding, that as F found F was deceived in the only woman whom I
could
The Disinterested Marriage. 141
could love, I should give up all thoughts of the feKssor the future.
“ How simple that is now! ” cried she, with a plaintive kind of tone, which was infinitely touching —
“ How can you reject a woman who is “ actually dying for you, and who can y make your fortune ”
“ Flow can you reject a man,” re-jtlied I, “ wsho is really miferable in “ confequence of your refufai ^ ”
“ Becaufe I cannot make his for-“ tune,” anfwered she; and the tears ilarted from her eyes while she fpoke— By tliofe tears, and by fuddenly turning , her face from me to conceal them, she convinced me that I was still very dear to her: yet all the eloquence with
which
142 The Disinterested Marriage*
which love infpired me — and furely thofe who are under the influence of that passion have more elocution than they are masters of upon common occasions, was not prevailing. She would not be moved by it. I was therefore obliged to leave the fubject, as she not not only requested me to fay no more upon it, but insisted upon my giving it up.
Lady Lucy’s uncommon behaviour has affected me fo much, that I honestly declare I wish I had been brought up in fome way to improve my estate, that I might be able to make her a more considerable offer; an offer more worthy of her acceptance. — But it is too late now—I am unsit for every thing.

Full of reflections last night, arifing from my very difagreeable fituation, I began to reproach myfelf for having given a loofe to unreafonabJe repinings, as if happinefs was no where to be met with but in afluent circumstances, and in exalted stations. Is it rational to fup-pofe that none except the rich can be happy ? How abfurd ! how unjust are fuch ideas! How few, how very few would taste felicity, were it confined to any particular fituation ! — No—happinefs is pretty equally diffufed over the whole world ; and the lowest often enjoy it, while the rich figh for it in vain.— The different notions entertained about pleafure, reSult chiefly from the different educations and purfuits of mankind.

From the fame to the fame^
AS I was determined to leave London, I began to prepare every thing for that purpofe : and as I am reSolved never to marry Lord Grassington, I had given my Servants orders not to let him in : however, bn his earnestly requesting to See me, I was weak e- • nough to hope that he relented, and that he was willing to releaSe me from all my engagements. I therefore admitted him.
He only Spent his time in making uSe of a thouSand arguments, to prevail on me to agree to what he wanted ; to make me believe that it was my father’s H 3	earnest
150 The Disinterested Marriage.
earnest desire, as well as his own, that I should marry him.
I would not be drawn in by the fliin-zinefs of his reafoning. I told him plainly, that if my father had been acquainted with my great aversion to him, he never would have been fo unkind as to leave me in fo difagreeable a situation : — adding, that since his will could not be revoked, I had nothing to do but to pay him the fum demanded ; the payment of which would give me a right to insist upon his not troubling me any more with his company.
“ And can you be fo cruel,” faid he, “ as to wish to inflict fuch a punish-“ ment upon me, only for admiring “ you; only for preferring you to all ‘‘ your fex ? ”
« It
The Disinterested Marriage. 151
“ It is infinitely more cruel in you,
“ my Lord,” anfwered I, “ to prevent “ me from marrying the man 1 like, by accepting of the greatest part of “ my fortune; to which you can have no other right than that which you “ derive from my father’s too partial “ will in your favour.”
“ I love you too sincerely to fee you in “ the arms of another, and therefore claim “ my right, Madam, to fo large a part of “ your fortune — That part, were you “ mine, should be in your own power, with “ a considerable addition to it from me;
“ and I would do every thing I could “ think of to render your situation “ agreeable to you. Were I' to- giv^e ; “ you up, you Would, I know, imme-“ diately give your hand to Frank-“ land, and fee me no more. It is very H 4	“ natural

In anfwer to this Speech I told him, that as I did not wish to receive favours from any body which I could not repay, I had rather fettle every thing, and break off all connections with him.
He replied, that I acted with great feverity, not to give him time to take every step in his power to gain my affections.
I anfwered,
The Disinterested Marriage. 153
I anfwered, that as I was fure I should only tantalize him by giving him any encouragement, I could not, without revolting against my confcience, adopt fuch a behaviour.
He then bowed, and faid he would leave me to reflect upon my extreme cruelty; hoping that my reflections' would produce a turn in his favour. |
Thus you fee, my dear, I have nothing to do but to endeavour to reconcile myfelf to the leaving Frankland and London—possibly for ever.

As foon as he retired I fat down, and, with a stood of tears, lamented the necessity I was under of affecting an indifference which I was far from feeling. At the very montent I drove him from me, I could have told him that I paf-fionately loved him. I even longed most earnestly to let him know how much he was beloved by me: to let him know that he, and he alone, was in poffession of my heart. It was the affection however I felt for him, which prevented me from making a difcovery of my fenfations to his ruin.

Indeed, my dear Bell, you must take care of yourfelf. This Plastow is a charming girl. I went down, thinking,

all the way, that nothing could furpafs Lady Bell Wallace; but you must know, my dear, that there are different kinds of beauties. Louifa Plastow is not only striking at first, but improves upon you every moment. She is tall and siender, and yet not too thin neither. She is the most nymphijh sigure you ever beheld: her whole form is genteel, her every motion is full of grace. She has a very clear complexion, foft, delicate, and enlivened with a beautiful glow of health. She is most amiably diffident, and makes, upon the whole, the most pittorefque appearance imaginable. She was dressed in a white lustring negligee with pale pink ribbons, and looked quite a Hebe. Fler converfation and'manners are no lefs striking than her perSon. Yet, perhaps,
. I may be partial: for she paid great

I mentioned Lord Ashbourn to her, and told her that I heard he was a very amiable man.
She replied, she was happy in having been left under his care, and that every body fpoke well of him.
She blushed, and her eyes fo prettily twinkled, while she was talking of him, that she is certainly, fome how, prepof-feffed in his favour.
When she left us, she folicited an intimacy with me, and in fuch perfuasive terms, that I could not have refufed '	her request, if she had not been half fo
I	pleasing

pleasing as she is. Besides, Mrs. Ellis is a most agreeable woman, and I wish to be acquainted with new people, if they are tolerable, in hopes of driving Frankland from my mind : but I fear that nothing I can do will prove effectual : he will, I fear, in fpite of all my efforts, engage my thoughts more than is warrantable by difcretion. I am talking of him, you fee, infensibly : I will, however, banish him from my memory, though he is fo defervedly dear to me. I will return to the amiable Plastow.— When jhe was gone, Mrs. Selby and I talked her over; my aunt told me, that she has a great many admirers ; adding, that Sir Francis Kempssield and Mr. Fanshaw are the most agreeable of them. The latter, in particular, she faid, has a very elegant perfon, and is exceedingly accomplished. -— “ He fre-
“ quently

“ quently calls upon me,” continued she, “ and I dare fay you will be pleaSed “ with him.”
Thus you See, my dear, I am in a way to be amuSed, at least : new objects will, most probably, divert my attention from the only one about which I ought not to employ my thoughts.

1 have more chat to communicate. I have returned the fair Plastow’s visit: we are become infeparable companions. She knows but little of Lord Ashbourne, She tells me that she was very young v/hen he went abroad, that she never faw him above three times, and that he was too manly to pay any attention to fuch a chit as she then was. She has
shewn
The Disinterested Marriage. i6g
shewn me a miniature of him which the. late Lord Ashbourne left her; it is fo handfome a one, that if there is a strong likenefs between the original and the copy, Bell, 1 shall feel fome pity for you.
After having informed me, that the refemblance was striking, Mifs Plastow very fensibly added, that she thought the finest perfon in the world is of fmall value, if it is not accompanied with a reSpectable understanding; the latter being, in her opinion, absolutely neceffary; eSpecialiy, in people who have much time upon their hands, to prevent them from running into miSchief by an improper employment of it.
Mifs Plastow employs her time ih^a very laudable manner. She draws, plays, VoL. I,	I	and

and sings with great taste. Between her first and fecond visit, Mr. Fanshaw came to fee Mrs. Selby, He is handfome, elegant, and genteel. There is much fenfe expressed in his face, and great foftnefs in his manners.
“ Mr. Fanshaw is quite charmed with “ you”—faid Louifa to rne the last time I faw her.
I replied, that it was not very likely he should pay any attention to me, after having been fo long acquainted with her.
She blushed, fmiled, and anfwered— “ Dear Lady Lucy, do not flatter me; “ for I shall love you extravagantly if ‘‘ you do.”
« And

“ I’ll tell you why” ■— replied she — “ Iwould not be too fond of any per--“ fon; I have fo much fensibility, that “ I am often distreffed by it. 1 am apt, “ indeed, to be violently pleafed ; but “ then I am apt to be as violently dif-“ concerted : and were I, taking a pro-r “ digious fancy to you, to be treated, in;

“ Perhaps your advice comes too “ late,” faid she, with her face and neck like crimfon.
This was fo fair an opening to a con-' sidential converfation on her part, that I immediately feized it; becaufe it is highly probable that I shall, ere long, languish for fomebody to talk to about Frankland.
“ So you really feel yourfelf in love ? “ and pray who is the favoured man
“ There you must excufe me,” replied she, still more difconcerted ; “ you “ would think me a little mad, if you “ knew Vs^ho he was.”

jectures, in conlequence of the obfer-vations I have made, are right, Fanshaw is the man : and I am strongly inclined to believe that she meant, by the above-mentioned addrefs to me, to indulge the pleafure she felt in talking of him, and to difguife her inclination for him at the fame time. However, my dearest Bell, you are fafe; and may reckon upon Lord Ashbourne as your own, though he is expected here every hour, and though Mr. and Mrs. Ellis are preparing to receive him in the most agreeable manner.
And now can I conclude without a single word concerning poor Frankland? I muJi—it is best for me to forget him ; as the remembrance of him must be attended with fenfations fatal to our peace. I will, therefore, for once, be difcreet, I 3	.	and

I am almost distracted! Frankland lies dangerousiy ill of a fever. Harriot Swymmer wrote me a particular account of his alarming fituation, as she received it from her brother, who goes to fee him every day. I can hardly tell what I

write—I have fent, however, to beg her to let me hear continually, by every posh how he is—If he should die, what would become of me ? Harriot has just hinted, that his difappointment with regard to me has occasioned his diforder. Good God ! Could I but have fuppoSed him fufficiently attached to me, to be fo much difordered by my refuSal, I believe I should have been indifereet enough to confent to a match which must have ruined him.—As it is, I cannot telFwhat to do. F have desired-Harriot, however, to contrive that he may know how constantly I enquire after him, and that I am miferable about him. If my extreme concern for his fufferings can give him the siightest re* lief, I shall think myfelf happy.

He is out of danger; pronounced to be fo at least by his physicians—Thank heaven ! I Seel my heart considerably lighter. I now retract Vv^hat I have Said in the former part of my letter : I will not marry him indeed, but he shall not be acquainted with this reSolution, that his Spirits may not be too Seriousiy aS-Sected bv it a fecond time. Poor dear fellow ! how exquisitely deiightSul is it to be So doated on by the man oS one’s heart!
I fuppofe
The Disinterested Marriage. 177
I fuppofe now. Bell, you want to hear of Lord Ashbourne, and I sind myfelf able to communicate a few remarks I have made; happening to be prefent when he first appeared at Ellis-Grove.
While Louifa and I were fitting in tlie musick-room, while she fang to her lute a pathetic air, and I listened with the'utmost delight, the door opened, and a very complete sigure entered the room with Mr. Ellis.
“ My Lord Ashbourne,” faid he.
His Lordship looked at us both, bowed; then, having again fur-veyed us, he advanced to poor Mist Plastow, whofe instrument was in the greatest danger. I really thought it I 5	would
lyS The Disinterested Marriage.
would have fallen to the ground, fo' exceedingly did her hands tremble.
Lord Ashbourne, obferving the violent agitation of her fpirits, very politely relieved her, by taking the instrument out of her hand, and placing it upon the table.	■	•
She blushed, and curtesied; when he made her foriie compliments upon her musical abilities, which had greatly charmed him, he faid, though he had heard them but for a moment: adding, that he begged he might not give the least interruption to performances which would be highly agreeable to him.,
“ I shall be almost afraid, my Lord,” replied she,, in ihejmost n^Hifical of all voices, “ to attempt TO perform before
y fo
The Disinterested Marriage. 179
“ fo excellent a judge as your Lord-“ ship ; who, just arrived from the land “ of harmony, must be still lefs able “ to relish my English manner.”
He replied, that fo much diffidence was a certain proof of her musical merit, and therefore intreated her to favour him with a fong.
She complied immediately; but the fear of not giving the pleafure she wished to give, rendered her voice fo tremu-p-lous, that she could hardly go through her fong, though my Lord encouraged her, by faying every thing that could be faid upon the‘occasion. I judged however, that he looked as if he did not fay half he thought. In short, Bell,

worst at once; and really he appears to me to be very much struck with her; she, alSo, feems to be no lefs charmed with him ; yet both of them feem afraid to difcover their feelings. There is a modesty, a diffidence and timidity in her, extremely becoming; and every woman of delicacy would shew her affection for her lover in that manner; but what could have difconcerted Lord Ashbourne fo much ? A man of his rank, fenfe and education, is feldom embarrassed by any girl, efpecially a girl who is his ward, and under his guidance and direction.—But I shall fee more in a little time, if Frankland recovers.—Should he not recover, I will not anfwer for the intellects of

I Thank you for your intelligence again, Lucy; though give me leave, at the fame time, to tell you, that it is not the most agreeable in the world; and to make it still lefs palatable, I am pretty fure it is true. Here is a Sir William Freeman who has made a strange fufs about me. Lord Ashbourne correfponds with him. In hopes of gaining my good-will, he has promifed to shew me all his Lordship’s letters.
It was just after I received your last, in which you gave fo sine a defcription of Mifs Plastow, that Sir William made the above-mentioned promife. To con-fefs the truth sincerely, the perufal of
your

your letter rendered me not a little envious and jealous. I fuffered the man, therefore, to do what he would, though I defpifed him in my heart at the fame time, for his treachery to his friend ! — But this love makes fools, and fome-thing worfe, of us all, as you will sind by the incloSed, which is a copy of one of Lord Ashbourne’s letters : I have tranfcribed it on purpofe for you, that you may judge, by this fpecimen, in what manner he will proceed. I am glad to sind that he has fome confcien-tious qualms, and would have all men, who feel themfelves guilty of fuch doubledealing, be thoroughly fensible of their error, and make all the amends in their power.—You will, I hope, carefully read this letter, and I beg you will fend me a particular account of Mifs Pia-stow’s fentiments about the writer of

I am very forry that you have fuf-f&red fo much ori account of Frankland’s illnefs, and ^ sincerely wish you may sind him worth grieving for. As men go, there are few to be lamented.
I confefs, however, I am fo difgusted with the whole fex at prefent, that I am not quite fo candid as I ought to be : yet I imagine that poor Ashbourne cannot help being fuch a weather-cock.

[ Inclofed in the foregoing. ]
I Arrived here last Tuefday, and have feen this fo much dreaded Mifs Plastow : dreaded indeed she ought to have

been by me—She has not only made me adore her, but abhor myfelf. — I, who thought Lady Bell Wallace fuperior to every other woman, now think Mifs Plastow more lovely than the loveliest of her fex. — In another week or two, perhaps, I may meet with half a dozen women still more desirable than either of thefe : yet fuch is the unfettled state of my mind, that my ficklenesses and caprices must inevitably render me unworthy of any woman’s affection and esteem. But you ought to be previously acquainted with every thing which relates to Mifs Plastow, or you may think worfe of me than I deferve: and yet you cannot entertain a worfe opinion of me than I do of myfelf.
To begin then—I think Mifs Plastow ' is one of the loveliest, one of the most
elegant
i86 The Disinterested Marriage.
elegant figures I ever beheld. There is fuch a fymmetry in her whole form, fo much grace in her every motion, fuch a lively bloom, arising from the happy combination of youth and health, in her countenance, fuch a dignity in her air, fuch a commanding fweetnefs in her afpect — I was abfolutely struck at the first sight of her 1 looked at her as at a fuperior being. I can hardly tell how I behaved, fo greatly was I dazzled by her charms. I felt mylelf, indeed, a mere non-entity. She, with a fweetnest peculiar to herfelf, though it was, at the fame time, accompanied with a kind of delicate timidity, strove to re-affure me, and has since paid me the most flattering deference.—She behaves with a fubmisi five refpect, fufficient to touch the most inSenfible. I have feveral times endea-

voured to convince her that her fub-missivenefs is by no means necessary. •— She tells me, with fuch an enchanting expression in her eyes, and fuch a melting foftnefs in her voice, that she will ever be obedient to her guardian, whom she reveres as a parent, having unfortunately lost both hers.^—fcarcely know what to fay to her, nor how to treat fo sine a young creature, who is all beauty in her form, all gentlenefs in her manners. She has a crowd of admirers, yet she distinguishes no man particularly, though fome of them appear to be very accomplished, and, in point of family and fortune, unexceptionable. As most of her admirers have applied to me, I ashed her, the other day, whom she preferred, whom she favoured with her esteem.
“ Indeed,
i88 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Indeed, my Lord,” replied she, “1 “ never gave myfelf the trouble to ex-“ amine their different merits.”
“ The man who is the object of your “ choice,” anfwered I, “ cannot be de-“ stitute of merit. You have a vecy “ good taste, and whoever is fortunate “ enough to be preferred by you, Mifs “ Plastow,” added I, with a sigh, which I could not fuppreSs, which I wished not to fupprefs, “ will be fure of my con-
currence.”
A roSy blush overSpread her fair face, at my So freely -promiSed conSent. She turned away her charming eyes, made a Silent curtfy, and abruptly leSt the room.
How
The Disinterested Marriage. 189
How odd was her behaviour 1 how very different from every other part of her conduct ! how exceedingly enigmatical ! .
When we met again, a foft kind of tender languor, which rendered her in-expreffibly lovely, was diffufed over her whole perfon. Now and then X caught her eyes fixed on mine; but she averted them immediately on my observing them, or when she Saw any body elSe take notice of them. Surely the dear, charming girl cannot be afraid of me, or do me the injustice to imagine that I shall ever wish to compel her. No—she shall be as free as air — she shall chuSe the man she likes, though I should die with envy at the fucceSs oS the happy mortal who gains her heart. — I cannot decently leave Lady Bell, nor honestly

I defpifed my father’s advice, thinking that he could not chufe properly for me : I fancied he had no taste'—How I wronged him ! He had chofen for me the most finished creature in the uniVerfe. Slighting his intentions, and neglecting, shamefully neglecting to comply with his injunctions, I have, indeed, rendered myfelf wretched, and, most probably, one woman unhappy: as I really believe that Lady Bell has a sincere, a tender regard for me. Pray heaven defend me from throwing any more women into a similar situation.— Should this Louifa ! — I shudder at the thought — I dare not indulge fuch an idea—I will stop here, lest I should go too far—I have already undone myfelf, i.	and

“ I have a great mind not do dance,” Said she, “ becauSe I do not know whom “ to six upon for a partner.”
“ You must give the preference to “ the man you like best,” replied I; “ that is easily done.”
“ But

“ Oh I 1 cannot, I cannot,” cried she, blushing.
Lord Ashbourne, at that moment, entered the room, and not a little increaSed both her blushes and her confusion.

I pitied the poor thing, and therefore told his Lordship that she was quite at a lofs whom' to accept of for a partner.
This simple fpeech of mine actually difconcerted him. The wifest people, fometimes, are puzzled to know what anfwer to return to the most foolish Ipeech imaginable.
He looked at her, as if he wanted to difcover in her eyes the wished-for information — “ Are you not determined,”
Said he, with a languishing air, and taking her hand, which he looked at as if he thought it the whitest and fofcest in the univerfe (it is a very handfome one)
“ whom you shall honour by choosing “ him for your partner	S

Well faid, child,” thought I;
“ this is carrying things as far as they “ will go.”—I fully expected his Lord-ship to take the hint, and make a fuit-able anfwer: but no fuch matter: he only sighed deeply, dropped her hand m a hurry, and Said, she wa$ entirely licr own mistrefs, and at liberty to grant Such a favour to the man whom she thought most deServing oS it.
She looked embarrassed, at being allowed a liberty she had no mind to make uSe of. After a little hesitation, she, with a kind of abashed archneSs, looked .

up in his face, and replied, “ Who “ does your Lordship dance with ?”
This well-timed question finished the businefs—He anfwered, in tranfported accents, I thought, “ With you, my “ dear Mifs Plastow ; if you will per-mit me to enjoy fo great a happi-nefs.”
Ishe little gipfey having now gained her point, faid, with a laughing fatisfaction in her eyes, while file most willingly threw her hand into his, “ Certainly, “ my Lord ; could you have any doubt “ concerning fuch a permiffion — looking a great deal more than she thought proper to fay, I fuppofe—They both appeared to be quite contented with each other.

My dear, dear Bell, how I have been shocked, and frightened ! terrified to death, at the unexpected appearance of Frankland, pale and emaciated ! yet he looked alfo inexpressibly amiable, and endearingly tender. He has almost undone me. The furprife I felt at the sight of him is not to be de-feribed.
While I was sitting, alone, in the breakfast-parlour, reading Thompfon’s works—Mrs. Selby was gone out in the chariot — John opened the door, and told me that a Gentleman from London was arrived.
Scarce

Scarce had he announced this Lon-don-Gentleman, when he appeared.— Frankland appeared.
I fcreamed with terror and amazement : but nobody minded me. The agreeable wretch advanced rapidly to the couch on which I fat, feized me in his arms, and embraced me fo clofely, that I really thought he would have deprived me of my breath.
“ Good God ! Mr. Frankland,” exclaimed 1, breaking from him, “ how “ came you here I how could you venture ?”—I faw plainly, indeed, that he was fo weak he could hardly stand; that he could hardly articulate a single fyl-lable.—He could only just get out— “ I am come to thank yoii”—and then

You may imagine what I felt—I actually believed that I faw him ready to expire.
Sitting down by him, I hurried out my falts, and put them into one of his poor, cold hands, while I rubbed the other as briSkly as I could, not knowing what in the world to do with him— I was quite wild with impatience to fee him recover—I committed a thoufand follies, I fuppofe : I faid fo many good-natured things to him, purely to comfort him, that he afolutely fell into raptures— and talked very madly. — He insisted on my confenting to be his immediately ; vented a vast quantity of lionfenfe about living in a cottage upon

love, and fwore fo vehemently, he would not leave me till I had folemnly pro-mifed to give him my hand in lefs than a fortnight, that I began to fear he had brought on his fever again by his raving, and was delirious.
You cannot conceive the terrifying situation in which I felt myfelf—Finding it altogether neceffary to coax him— for I began to be afraid cf him, and for him—-I faid—“ Now do, let me prevail “ on you, Mr. Frankland, to go qui-“ etly home : you want rest: this jour-“ ney has been too much for you: how “ could you undertake it ? an& alone “ too ? but I will fend a fervant with “ you.”

“ Am I really your Frankland ?” anfwered he, looking wildly at me, and grafping my hands with a kind of tender violence — “ You do not fpeak, “ Lady Lucy — you do not fay that I am your Frankland.

“ What charming, what tender- ex-“ preshon beams in thofe dear eyes! ” cried he, looking at me with fuch meaning in his own, that I was both af-Sected and Srighted; and I could not, once, help faying, — “ Do, my dear “ Frankland, leave me now: you are “ really by no means right; you will “ bring on your Sever again.—-Come, ‘‘ you Jhdl go home.”

on him to stir; I really feared too that he was light-headed. — Luckily, while I was embarrassed, my aunt returned.— Being informed that Frankland was in the parlour, she came in out of compliment to me, to welcome him. I in-treated her to stay with me, and with her assistance, at last I prevailed on him to get into the carriage, after having made him take fome refreshment, and insisted upon his letting John go behind it, to fee him fafe to town, and to bring me word how he left him. All this feemed to pleafe him exceedingly ; but when, to prevent any future jour-nies of the fame kind, I told him very fcrioLissy, calling Mrs. Selby to witness what I faid, that, till my fortune was mended, I would never more fee him, he changed colour, and trembled fo much, that I was actually on the point
of

of recalling my words. I could not, however, help adding, that he might depend upon my relerving myfelf for him alone, but that there were a number of reafons just nov/ for my intreating him not to desire what I could not pof-fibly comply with. He appeared to have still a mind to expostulate, but Mrs. Selby and I looking as if we really both wished him fairly out of the houfe, he took his leave at last, yet with fo violent an embrace, that I thought he would have quite devoured me. He mufi be difordered in his head: poor dear fellow ! he never ufed to take fuch liberties. How very much do I pity him! Indeed, Bell, I am extremely unhappy, for this last interview has made him a thoufand times worfe than ever; but I ought not fo tire you perpetually with my asthirs, and I have no

He, indeed, endeavours to stifle his growing pashon, but Jhe indulges hers; yet with a modesty and delicacy that cannot but be pleasing.— What a pity it is he did not fettle his affections upon Louifa before he became acquainted with you; for as things are at prefent, I am afraid you will all fuffer considerably. In short. Bell, this love, if it does not prove fuccefsful, occasions more anxiety than delight; and 1 begin to sind myfelf exceedingly dif-quieted by it.—I am, however.

Lord Ashbourne to Sir William Freeman.
[Inclofed in the foregoing.]
WH AT a fituation am I in! a ss-tuation which would make most men quite happy, but it has thrown me into the greatest perplexity,
VoL, I.	L	Plastow,
2i8 The Disinterested Marriage.
Plastow, this amiable, this charming plastow, certainly prefers me to all her admirers.—A most animating certainty, you will fay—I sind it far otherwife; and yet, after all, perhaps I only fancy she prefers me.—We are very apt to realize our wishes.—Surely, however, I cannot be fuch a coxcomb as to deceive myfelf fo egregioussy; but you, who aie impar-^ tial, you shall hear, and judge.
She came down a few days ago with a miniature on her arm, fet with brilliants, but bound only with a piece of black velvet; yet nothing could have made the showy foftnefs of the siesh appear to greater advantage, I was half distracted to know who was happy e-nough to Be fo distinguished.—Then curbing my impetuous fancy, I began to think it might be the portrait of her
father.

father, or mother, or fome other relation. However, I advanced to fatisfy my curiosity.—Guefs my astonishment to sind a miniature of myfelf.
We both blushed.
Taking hold of one of the finest hands in the world, I tenderly pressed it. The charming girl endeavoured to make fome apology, by telling me that my father had left it her.—A good memento, thought I, with regard to other legacies still dearer, still more valuable. I only kindly anfwered, that since she did me fo much honour as to wear my refemblance, I begged her to render it a more desirable ornament, by the acceptance of a string of pearls, as I had feen no arm which would shew them to fuch advantage.
L z	She
220 The Disinterested Marriage.
She fmiled, blushed, cast down her fweet eyes, and faid she was greatly o-blifred to me.
Charming creature! I had the tran-fporting pleaSure to See her wear them the next day. In short, site does every tiling to pleaSe me, to six my heart for ever : and yet I dare not think of her.
I have already engaged myfelf; I have given my promife to another; I must be a villain, therefore, to pretend to her. The very idea makes me quite .sick; my head turns round.
In Continuation.
I am So out of Spirits, So very much disordered, that I know not what to do with mySdf. I am So incapable, alSo, of

What an angel is this Louifa! She fees my inability to Support mySelf under the preffure of my ciiSquietudes; Sne Sees how Severely I am distreffed, by not being able to make advantage of the delightful partiality fire hourly diScovers for me. I have been fo dejected, fo pitied, indulged, and attended to, that I can never continue much longer here. I shall undo her, mySelf, Lady Bell, and every body.
I fcarcely Spoke all day, yesterday; LouiSa followed me about, enquired over and over where my pain lay, offered ms her eau de luce bottle, and Setched me flowers to Smell to ; and when she Saw me, aSter dinner. So little in a condition L 3	to

to fustain a part of the converfation, as to retire into the next room, she came after me. There, with the most perfuasive looks, and in the most melting accents, she desired me to try to sleep.
I told her it was impoffible for me to clofe my eyes.
“ Recline on this fofa, then,” faid she, “ and I will sing to you with my ‘‘ lute, or read you to rest.”
1 complied with her good-natured propofais, merely becaufe she fo earnestly folicited my assent to them; becaufe I receive the highest fatisfaction from giving her pleafure, and becaufe I could not resist the enchanting delight I felt in giving her an opportunity to shew me how far her friendship would carry
her.

her. Throwing mySelf, therefore, immediately upon the fofa, I desired her to sit down in a chair by me. She then took up her lute, and fung in fo ravishing a style, that I could hardly keep my * tranfports within bounds.—I pretended, however, to try to sleep, and covered my face with my hand ; by fo doing I faw ail her proceedings through my singers.
When she had finished her fong, she laid down her lute foftly on the table, perceiving me lie very quiet, and fat down again by me, looking at me with the greatest tendernefs. Now and then a gentle sigh heaved her lovely bofom : yet she did not stir.—Pretending, at last,-to be fast asleep, I let my head drop lower on the cushion, still, however,

keeping myfelf in a position to behold her beauties.
When I had been for fome time in that situation, she roSe foStly, as I did not move, came nearer to me, and at length knelt down in order to examine me more clofely.-^—Flesh and blood could not bear this.—To fee her So near me, to Seel her breath upon my cheek! —Oh ! there was no enduring it.-—I removed my hand Srom my Sace, and instantaneously—involuntarily I may fay, threw it round her neck.
Starting back, she looked abashed, alarmed; yet, at the fame time, was, evidently, not difpleaSed, though it was certainly neceffary Sor her to appear fo. She attempted to riSe, but I gently detained her, while I read every tender

“ I have indeed,” replied she, covered with blushes of a deeper dye, “ nobody to blame but myfelf—but I “ went to look at—I mean I dropped “ fomething,. I believe,” continued she, totally difconcerted.—“ Pray ex-“ cufe me, my Lord,” concluded she, —and rushed out of the room.
Is it not plain now. Freeman, that she is far from being indifferent about me ? But I have a still more unquestionable proof of her prepoffession in my favour.
Being very restlefs, and wretched indeed, I went after her. I found her
sitting

sitting on a garden-feat, leaning her head upon her hand.
Sitting down by her, I took her hand again.—“ You are not quite angry with “ me, my dear Mifs Plastow, I hope ?”
“ I am angry with nobody but my-“ felf, my Lord.”
“ You will not be angry at all, then, ■ “ Madam,” anfwered 1; “as no woman ■ “ can possibly conduct herfelf with “ greater propriety.”
She sighed, she blushed, she withdrew her hand.—Then looking at me earnestly, she gave it to me again. I feized it with tranfport, and pressed it to my lips with an ardour fully Sufficient to convince her that I Seel the warmest L 6	passion

LETTER XXXL Lady Lucy ta Lady Bel l.-
IAm fet down to tell you, what you fo earnestly desire to know, Mhs Plastow’s fentiments concerning her lover. I can gratify your curiosity with the greatest eafe, as she has opened every fold of her little heart to me, without giving me the trouble to difcover mine.
While I was sitting, a few days ago, in one of the temples in the garden, she came in the prettiest stutter of fpirits, i-maginable, and throwing herSelf down by me, faid she had brought her work, - and was come to chat with, me. She then took out her work, but appeared
to
230 The Disinterested Marriage.
to be in great confusion, and feemed hardly to know what she was about.
“ How is Lord Ashbourne ?” faid I, carelessly.
She blushed excessively, anti replied, that he was not at all well.
Seeing that she had a desire to talk of him, I gave her all decent encouragement.
“ He is a very fensible man,” continued I.
This fet her a going.
“ Only the moft amiable of men,” anfwered she, echoing, “ I have ever
met with.”
“ How
The Disinterested Marriage. 231
“ How happy are you, my dear Mifs “ Plastow, to be under the care of fuch “ a man!”
“ I don’t know that,” faid she, very much embarrassed. “ People may be “ too agreeable fometimes.”
“ Surely that is, imposhble,” replied I, laughing.
“ Not at all.—I wish I could think “ fo :—but I fear I shall find Lord Ash-“ bourne too pleassng.”
“ There is no harm, my dear,” faid I, “ in being pleafed with people of “ merit; and Lord Ashbourne has cer-“ tainly a considerable share.”
“ You
2^2 The Disinterested Marriace.
“ You don’t understand me,” anfwered she, blushing extremely; “ I “ am afraid of liking Lord Ashbourne “ better than he likes me.”
a
Certainly that cannot be,” faid I, “ though your modesty will not let you “ think fo.”
“ Oh ! you do not know,. Lady Lu-“ cy, how ridiculouily I have behaved; “ but, indeed, I could no way help it. “ I felt an irresistible impulfe, urging “ me beyond a possibility of retreat. “ You cannot imagine what I have done. “ No woman should ever let a man “ read her fentiments about him, be-“ fore he has made a declaration in her favour. Oh! my dear Lady Lucy, “ Lord Ashbourne mufi know that I am “ partial to him. I have difcovered ail
y the
The Disinterested Marriage. 233
“ the tendernefs of my heart, which he “ could not mistake, and it encouraged “ him to take many liberties I ought “ not to have permitted.”
“ Blefs me, Mifs Plastow,” cried I, “ what can his Lordship have done to “ make you talk in this manner ?”
‘‘ Oh! ” replied she, “ I was fo af-“ fedted by his indifposition—but I do “ not know how to tell you—and yet I “ will try.—Being extremely hurt by his “ continual complaints, his continual . “ dejection, I availed mySelf of every “ foothing art to relieve him ; I begged “ him to try to steep while I fung to “ him—My efforts fucceeded ; he fell “ fast asieep, as I imagined, and I was “ then tempted to take a little nearer “ view of him.—You know he is very
handfome
234 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ handfome—I knelt down before him, “ only to examine his sine perfon, which “ I cannot venture to look at with at-“ tention, when his piercing eyes are “ levelled at me.—To be fure, it was “ exceedingly foolish in me—-but, as I “ faid, my dear Lady Lucy, I was “ driven by a force not to be resisted, “ to act fo inconsistently, and in a man-“ ner which revolted fo much against “ modesty and difcretion.—Waking on “ a fudden, he threw his hand round “ my neck, and drew me clofe to him.—It “ is impoffible for me to defcribe my “ fenfations, or for you to conceive vrhat I felt. I broke from him, at “ last, and hurried away. He followed “ me, begged my pardon, and was fo “ refpectful, fo tender, that I did not “ know what to fay to him.”
“ You
The Disinterested Marriage. 235
“ You are now, then, upon the foot-“ ing of lovers” faid I, interrupting her.
“ Oh ! noreplied she, drawing up a little, “ we are not: Lord Ashbourne, “ indeed, has a right to pretend to me. “ —He had his own father’s and my “ father’s leave—What then can hinder “ him, if he has really an inclination ?— “ If he has not,” added she, with a fwelling sigh, “ why then —> he ought “ not to take the notice of me he has “ done. He ought not to feed me with “ hopes that are never to be attended ‘‘ with fuccefs.”
Here a few tears started from her eyes, and rolled down her pretty face.
The
236 Tfie Disinterested Marriage.
The gentleman in question immediately appeared.—He told her, by way of apology for his abruptnefs, that Mrs. Ellers had just heard of the unexpected coming of fome company to dinner. — “ Mrs. Ellers,” continued he, “ thought it would be agreeable to “ you to know this intelligence in time, “ and was going to dilpatch a fer-“ vant; but I desired I might fave her “ that trouble—” He then, advancing nearer towards Louifa, law the tears still trembling in her eyes—^With a look exquisitely tender, he took her hand.—^ “ What is the matter, my dear Louifa P* faid he.
“ Nothing, my Lord,” anfwered. she, pulling away her hand hastily—“ Nq-thing,” added fiie, turning from him.
This
The Disinterested Marriage. 237
This coolnefs hurt him, I perceived, exceedingly. He feized her hand, however, again, though I was prefent, and faid fomething to her in a low key— but in foothing, in affectionate accents.
A fecond time she drew her hand from him, came to me, and took hold of my hand.
Thus, repeatedly distanced, he made no more attempts of the fame kind, but sighed, and looked as if he was quite undone; for she kept up a referve— while I staid at least—which prevented -any appearance of a reconciliation : yet her train all Seem to think themSelves in a hopeieSs condition. Fanshaw, the prettiest fellow among them, would fain enlist himSelf in my Service, but no man ever can Supplant Frankland; though, to do Fanshaw justice, he has every requisite
238 The Disinterested Marriage,
quisite to pleafe, with that very neceffary addition, a large, independent fortune, which will be entirely at my dif-pofal, he tells Mrs. Selby, on my deigning to honour him with my hand. Mrs. Selby is a strong advocate for Fanshaw, but I can never take my heart from his powerful rival, and bestow it on another. I would not, on any account, give Frankland reafon to charge me with a dif-honourable conduct, were I not fo sincerely attached to him as I am.—We complain of the sicklenefs of the men— too many of our fex encourage them to be fo by their own caprice. However, though I can never love Fanshaw, I cannot poffibly deny him my esteem. He deferves every thing indeed, as he behaves in a noble, disinterested manner. When he first made his addresses to me, his behaviour was particularly genteel: s	he
The Disinterested Marriage. 239
he opened them with an apology for the abruptnefs of his carriage, affuring me, at the fame time, that he should not have ventured to fpeak upon the fubject, near as it was to his heart, had he not been credibly informed I had rejected a very amiable man, under the in-fiuence of the most generous motives.
-— “ Struck with you at sirst sight,” continued he, “ I could not help wish-•“ ing that I had known you before I at-“ tached myfelf to Mifs Plastow: and “ I hope that I shall not be lowered in “ your opinion, by faying that I should ■“ not have left her, had I not found it “ out of my power to touch her heart.”
I assured him, in return, that I admired his franknefs, but repeatedly declared I could only bestow my esteem on him.
He
240 The Disinterested Marriage.
He replied, that it should be the study of his life to deferve the continuance of it, and begged I would not refufe him opportunities to improve his acquaintance with me.
I neither granted nor rejected that request; we are, therefore, rather upon an intimate footing.
In Continuation.
Poor Frankland has had a relapfe,inconfequence, I fear, of his hasty visit to me: he is, however, a fecond time out of danger. I really Suffer exceedingly upon his account. In the midst of my distresses occasioned by Ns returning diSorder, I was persecuted with fresh felicitations from Lord Grashngton, whom Mrs. Selby, when I did not in the least expect him,
admitted
The Disinterested Marriage. 241
admitted to me. I was both grieved, and out of humour, at having just heard of Frankland’s relapfe, and therefore gave my Lord a very indifferent reception indeed. I believe I was more fret-* fill and peevish than I have ever been since he first faw me. My peevishnefs fo difgusted him to a degree; fo much w:as he offended at it, that finding he could make nothing of me, he retired, and left me at liberty to indulge my own melancholy and difcontent. Fanshaw, feeing me in a state bordering upon defpair, in his opinion, exerted himfelf greatly to amule me; but his em deavours were not attended with the desired fuccefs. I am under considerable obligations to him, however, for the pains he has taken to pleafe me; and I have tried to express my acknowledgements in the most grateful terms. My Tol. I,	M	acknow-

acknowledgments of the grateful kind are, I fancy, mistaken shy .Mrs. Selby: she imagines, 1 dare fay, that a tenderer passion has no fmall share in them. J, on the contrary,^ who, certainly, best know my own heart, am very fensible that I .shall neverffeel a more tender paS-sion than I feel for :him at prefent: yet I am incapable of refusing him the politenefs and consideration to which he is justly intitled from

Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborough.’
I Have been prevented from anfwering your letter by a return of my fever; it still hangs about me, and makes me unfit for every thing.
Lady Lucy, who correfponds with Mifs Swymmer, has expressed great concern at my illnefs, and fays that I in-creafed it by coming down to Selby-Park before I was well enough to undergo the fatigue of fuch a journey. Part of this, I believe, is true, as my fpiritis were fo violently agitated at the sight of her, after she had fpoken fo tenderly about me to Harriet Swymmer, that the shock, weak as my condition then was, too much affected me. However, though M ' 2	. it
244 Disinterested Marriage,
it is very evident that Lady Lucy loves me, she will, on no account, confent to an union with me : an union which mush she fays, effectually ruin us both. Yet she declares, at the fame time, that, had she not lost the greatest part of her fortune, she would marry me to-morrrow. There is a fatisfaction, indeed, in hearing of that declaration —but she is too generous—she will never, she fays, di-strefs the man whom she loves. I tell her, that the difeiofure which I made of my paffion for her was entirely occasioned by that loSs, as I never should have prefumed to addrefs her, had I not thought we were more on a level by it, —All I can fay, however, is to no purpofe—I cannot prevail on her to agree to the accomplishment of my wishes. 1 hardly think it right, indeed, to be too pressing. No*—my estate is much too
trifling
• The Disinterested Marriage. 245
trifling for the provision of a woman of her birth and connections : and she cannot, without degrading herfelf, think of -being united to the owner of it.—But then, on the other hand, I cannot help wishing, that I had never been acquainted with fo desirable a creature.—A female companion, ’tis true, was ever the ardent desire of my heart; I have met with one who has every charm, per-fonal and intellectual, to make me Supremely blest : but—we are not destined to be happy with each other—Without ‘ her I cannot now be happy : happineSs, thereSore, in this world, I ceaSe to expect.'—My health is in a very uncertain state ; and it is more than probable, that I may never enjoy its re-establishment.-— Yet, as the dear cauSe oS all my Sufferings has been kind enough to intreat me to take care oS my health, and as my
physi-

physicians affure me that nothing but change of air, and exercife, can give me a chance for recovering ; I am de-• termined to go down^ and exijl upon my estate, as long as I am able to remain in the world. 1 cannot hope to live, that is, to have any relish for Ufe, without her, by whom alone life can be rendered eligible.
Yours, See. &c,
G. Frankland!
LETTER XXXin.
Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
Frankland is gone down to Oak-Abbey to live, without having taken leave of me; without having even desired to fee me. He has removed
every
The Disinterested Marriage. 247
every kind of thing that belonged to him in London, as if he never designed to fee it again. I felt myfelf offended at this precipitate, this unadvifed step ; as I fuppofed it to be—like a giddy, thoughtlefs creature, as I am. I mentioned it to Harriet Swymmer, She told me in reply, that he went entirely by order of his physician, who thought him in great danger.
You cannot think how I was fluttered by this anfwer. If Frankland should' not recover, I shall be vain enough to imagine myfelf accessary to his death : that will absolutely kill me. My heart shrinks at the bare idea oS it, I believe I should be quite in deSpair, did not Fanshaw’s company relieve me : he gives up his whole time to me, he amuSes me ; —- that is, he endeavours to amuSe I	me—
24S The Disinterested Marriage. '
me—I cannot be amufed : I have no relish for any thing. I, still, accufe myfelf, perpetually—or rather accufe my untoward fate, which will not let me be happy,—My poor dear fellow too, his , fate feems to be equally untoward. The only ufe I make of Fanshaw is, to talk _ to him continually of Frankland : and he listens to me, he encourages me, with a patience which is very uncommon : it is, however, very pleasing : yet he will never fucceed with me, whatever he may think. I sind I cannot live without Fkankland: if, therefore, he should not get well, you may reckon me among the incurables alfo.
Adieu for the prefent.

infected by our melancholy, if you have not already caught it. Yet 1 think you had better come : I will give up Fanshaw to you. As you feem, both, to be difappointed exactly in the fame manner, you may very well administer confolation to each other.
Do you know that I, frequently, keep open my letters, in hopes of hearing fomething more entertaining to add ?— I have now, by fo doing, an opportunity to fend you a little anecdote concerning Lord Ashbourne and Mifs Plastow, which may be of fervice to you.
Yefterday I made a visitsto Mrs. Ellis. 1 ouifa, who was in her dreffmg-room, fent to let me know that she was not well, and to beg me to come up stairs.
I obeyed

1 obeyed her fumrnons, and found her sitting quite in an undrefs with her eyes fwelled with crying, while her little heart was ready to burst with grief.
I could not help exclaiming at the sight of her in fo afflicted a condition, and enquiring into the caufe of it.
“ Oh, my dear Lucy!” replied she; “ I was right when I told you that Lord “ Ashbourne could never be any thing “ more to me, than my guardian.”
“ Why not, my dear ?” faid 1; “ you “ only fancy fo : I am fure Lord Ash-“ bourne is in love with you.”
“ So he tells me,” anfwered she, with a charming simplicity. “ Fle tells me “ he loves me; but still that signisies B 2	nothing :

“ nothing: and yet he has behaved fo “ fweetly—I will inform you of the “ whole affair. I bad great reafon, you “ know, to be diSpleafed both with him “ and myfelf. I thought I had been “ much too forward, and that he had “ given me improper encouragement: “ I, therefore, refolved to correct both; “ in doing which, I was, necessarily, “ obliged to behave with much cool-“ nefs : I appeared indifferent, when I “ was, really, far from being fo. Lord “ Ashbourne complained of my indif-“ ference in very refpectful terms, and ‘‘ desired to know if he had, inadver-“ tently, done any thing to offend “ me. I made a flight anfwer, I be-“ sieve, and was going to leave him. “ He then caught me by the gown, as “ I had withdrawn my hand, and cried «« .—Stay only one moment, MiSs Pla-*	“ flow.

Throwing himfelf “ upon his knees before me, he took “ my hands in his, laid his face on them, “ and afked me, with inexpressible ten-“ derneSs, why I wept; adding, that “ my tears gave him the most cutting “ diSquiet.—I could not help owning ‘® that I lamented our not having met “ Sooner, when we were both not only “ at liberty to love, but encouraged to “ preSer each other to all the world, by “ thoSe who had a right to direct and “ adviSe us : I could not help owning “ too, that the pleaSure I had felt in “ knowing I was beloved by him, was cruelly lessened by the consideration “ that we were never to meet—without “ Lady Bell’s refufai.—Thus you fee, “ my dear Lady Lucy,” continued the

Not being able to dive into your fentiments upon this fubject, I could not give Louifa any hopes, at the conclusion of her unreferved difclofures. I know how I should act myfelf in fuch circumstances—I think I know what I should do in fuch a situation; but when an enchanting fellow is become master of our hearts, reafon, I fear, has little insluence: love reigns over us with a tyrannic fway.—Poor Frankland! how I wish to hear that he is better 1 how I wish to have it in my power to make him as happy as he deferves to be.—

Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborough.
I Thank you for your concern, and for your anxiety about me, though they will be of no advantage to me, as I think I am pretty far gone in an incurable distemper; but as it is one of the flattering kind, I am the more eompofed under it; for though I belie,ve I really grow worSe, I am frequently weak enough to fancy I am better.
When
The Disinterested Marriage. . 11
When I sirst came down here, I took great pleafure in planting, fowing, and improving my little estate; hoping, that if I could ever make an advantageous change in it. Lady Lucy might be tempted to confent to our mutually enjoying the prosits arising from it; as Ido actually think it is possible for two people to be happy in this Sequestered Spot, even aSter having Seen better days, I am not, however, a mere folitary: I have neighbours who most earnestly court my acquaintance; but since the lofs oS her in whom alone my Soul delighted, I am become averfe to any fociety, and glide away at the sight of a human creature, like a ghost at the approach of morning. I hear that I am complimented with the title of the handfome phantom—What trifiing is this, however, in a man who is, per-B 6	haps,

haps, near his end ! — As Lady Lucy attaches herfelf to Fanshaw, the fooner 1 am removed out of a world in which I have no bufineSs, the better. Yet— heaven is my witneSs, I do not, cannot blame her. I ever wished her to be happy, and, if the character given to me of this gentleman is a just one, he is thoroughly capable of making her fo. As she is now cured of the partiality with which she once honoured me, a favour entirely unmerited, a fa^ VQur never to be fufficiently acknowledged, I cannot possibly ever repay it. I can only make a poor attempt towards the payment, by leaving her all I pof-feSs: that all is too little to be worth her acceptance: but I cannot leave her any more : yet what I can leave her will, I hope, in fome meaSure make up for the ungenerous behaviour of Lord GraSs-

Lady Lucy, to Lady Bell.
IH A V E received a letter of Frankland’s to a friend, inclofed in one of Harriot Swymmer’s to me, which has shaken all my wife refolves, and will fend me down with expedition to Oak-Abbey, to fuperintend the dairy, while he manages the farm. In short, Bell, the poor dear fellow is in a decline, and fancies that I am going to be married to Fanshaw, and talks of making his will. I shall certainly lofe him for ever, if I do not hasten to relieve him.
You will tell me, perhaps, that I shall repent of this rash, unadviSed step : but pray be quiet, child ; I am of age,

and hold myfelf wife enough to know what will make me happy: and as for the opinion of others, I give it to the winds. I would rather stand the ridicule of the brightest circle at court; I would rather be shunned by the men, and fniffed at by the women, than give a moment’s pain to the honest, generous heart, which sincerely loves me. No, Bell: I will throw off the sine Lady, and put on the farmer’s wife: but I must hurry, or elfe it will be too late, and the poor fellow will be quite gone. I would not come upon him too fuddenly neither: yet I must-be expeditious. I will not fend for him hither—I will go to Oak-Abbey myfelf. Mrs. Selby, who has talked very ferioussy upon this fubject, has promifed to accompany me. The Swymmers too must be of the party. What a strange

LETTER XXXVI.
Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborough.
WHAT tranfportingjoy! Lucy, my dear Lady Lucy, has been here. Never was furprife equal to mine, at
the
The Disinterested Marriage. 17
the sight of her. I was above half a a mile from the houfe, feeing my fellows load a cart with a fecond crop of hay. Robert, hurrying up to me, quite out of breath, informed me that a coach full of company had drove into my court-yard,
“ Company ! ” faid I, eagerly.
“ Yes, Sir,” replied he, “ three La-“ dies, and a Gentleman: they are “ come to dinner; for they ordered the “ coachman to fet up at the best houfe “ in the village: I told them that we “ had room in our stables.”
What an officious rafcal! thought I—To fay the truth. Jack, I found myfelf in no fort of humour for visiters, nor was I, by any means, prepared for
their
iB The Disinterested Marriagt.,
their reception. So totally indeed was I unsit to fee them, that I could almost have quarrelled with my fervant for having admitted them.—Before I thought of ashing who they were, he prevented me, by telling me that the Gentleman’s name was Swymmer; that there was a Mifs Swymmer, and a Lady Lucy Something, he could not tell what—Robert ' is quite a country fellow: I did not chufe to bring any man from town with me, well knowing that your London fervants are much too lazy to .be of any fervice here.,.
The name of Lady Lucy startled me a little. I must have been half distracted to have expected a visit from her; yet I sighed, I wished, I felt inex-preffible emotions at the bare mention of her.
While
t
The Disinterested Marriage. 19
While I was lost in a reverie entirely on her account, she appeared before me.
Surprifed as I had been at the mention of her name, I was now agitated in a manner not to be defcribed. I hastened to meet her: Jhe alfo quickened her steps. When she came nearer, she held out her hand to me. I feifed it with eagernefs, and pressed it to my bofom, to my lips.
“ Lady Lucy ! ” faid I, with a faint voice, hardly to be heard, “ what hap-“ pinefs to fee you ! ”
“ Frankland,” replied she, with a blushing timidity, which ^ave her a thoufand additional charms, “ I am “ come—’’
Here
20 The Disinterested Marriaoe, Here she stopped.
“ You are come,” anfwered I, “to “ make me the happiest of men—
I was proceeding, but she interrupted me.
“ I am indeed, if it is still in;* mv * ¥

“ Every thing is in your power,**" cried I, tranfported.
“ I fear you over-rate it,” faid she, with a modest tendernefs in her eyes— “ Tell me—can I do any thing to-re-store your health?”
“ You can restore my peace,” replied I, catching her to my bofom;
“ you.
The Disinterested Marriage. 21
you can give me life and happinefs “ by giving me yourfelf.”
Take me then,” anfwered she : and
pray heaven I may not have given my-“ felf too late! ”
Imagine my joy, Deshorough—I cannot defcribe it—I only know that I ex-preffed it by rapturous embraces, and by a fwift fuccession of fwelling sighs, fufficient to convince her more forcibly than a thoufand words, how exquisitely dear she was to my doating heart.
She too remained silent, while a tear of fensibility stole down her glowing cheek.
I kissed it off, and then aSked the meaning osi it.
“ Are
22 The Disinterested Marriage,
“ Are not my terrors concerning’ “ your health,” replied she, “ strong “ enough to make me extremely anxious “ about it?”
“ Banish all your terrors,” faid I, “ my health will foon be re-established, “ as my mind is now at eafe.”
The dear amiable creature, pleafed with my affurances, foon refumed her wonted chearfulnefs; and, after having declared her determination to be mine, as foon as every thing could be fettled, desired me to return with her to the friends of us both who had accompanied her, and who had expressed great fatisfaction at our approaching union.
“ I made an opposition to Lucy,” faid Mrs. Selby, “ merely to give her
“ time
The Disinterested Marriage. 23
time to reflect on what she was about; but I now confefs that you are both “ very uncommon characters, and can-not fail of happinefs, becaufe your “ plan of life is fo unfashionably ra- | “ tional.”
I thanked her for her good opinion, entertained all my friends in the best manner I was able, and kept them till late in the evening. I then infisted upon going with them part of the way home, on horfeback.— Swymmer was fo con-fiderate as to refign his place in the coach to me, and rode my horfe, till my tender Lucy, fearing it might be dangerous for me to return with only one fervant, would not let me go fo far as I had defigned. I am now preparing to attend her in London. She is on the point of fetting out, in order to accelerate

A Strange fcheme indeed ! And are you really ^capable of carrying fo abfurd a design into execution ? Can you confent to bury yourfelf alive ^ I am ready to allow that your man— from your defcription of him—is an 4	un-
The Disinterested Marriage. 25
uncommon character, a pheenomenon in the world of gallantry, a difmterefted lover: but consider, my dear Lucy, how can you, who have been bred up with a relish for all the elegant refinements of life, bring yourfelf to be shut up in a dull, dirty, and obfeure country village? Flow will you bear yourfelfinthe vulgar character of a country houfewife, after having figured as a woman of fashion ? Your narrow fcheme may, perhaps, be a very prudent one, but furely it cannot be very palatable : it can only be pleasing, I imagine, to thofe who feel themfelves inclined to laugh at you. Indeed, my dear, I never thought that you, with your excessive vivacity, and uncommon accomplishments, would d\yindle into a tame houfehold dove, and give up every joy in life; that excepted, arising from the VoL. II.	C	fociety
26 The Disinterested Marriage.
fociety of only one perfon. Surely, my fiear, by thus confining yourfelf to one man, you difcover a very limited taste, a much narrower mind than I thought you poffeffed.
You will be poffibly offended at my freedom, • and think, that as I am under the dominion of the tender passion myfelf, 1 ought to have (pared you, merely upon fympathetic considerations. I am not, however, preciSeiy in the situation you fuppofe me to be: I have, indeed. So Sar got the better of the “ little love lurking in my heart, v/hich was, in truth, only a plague to me, that I am now as free as air. Yet, though I do not interest mySdf Suisiciently about Lord Ashbourne, to make mySelf uneaSy on his account, I shall, nevertheless, , expect him to perform kis part of

the contract between us. I would have men cured of the ridiculous propensity they have to make love to every woman they fee : a propensity which has proved fatal to many-- many of our fex. I think, therefore, that we ought not only to be upon our guard against any future designs of that fort, but to do every thing in our power to punish thofe who have already acted in fo infamous a manner. I look upon a fellow of this fort as a fcandalous character, and unworthy of the attention cf a woman with the least degree of merit. You will imagine, no doubt, from thefe far-castical effusions, that I am out of humour with all mankind. I can affure you, however, that you are mistaken: I can even affure you tjiat I esteem your Frankland, if he is really the man he appears to be ; nor would I fay a single C 2	word

word against your plan, did I not fear your being unhappy in a way of life to which you have never been accustomed, and which will be fo very new to you, that you will not be able to tell me whether you like it or not: all will, no doubt, be very fair and sine at first, but in a short time you will feel the difference. You will fay indeed, per» haps, that you should be much more unhappy with Grassington: but are there not other men vastly fuperior to btm in fenfe, and quite equal to him in point of fortune ^ You had a lover, the very man for you: Fanshaw was exactly the perfon whom I would wish you to marry: yet you, like a perverfe creature, will throw yourfelf away on this Frankland, merely becaufe he is handfome. Really, Lucy, I pity you,
and
The Disinterested Marriage. 29
and in return for my compassion, I expect you to give me all possible information relating to the lovely Louifa and her charming guardian, my faithlefs Ashbourne, as I do not fuppofe yoU intend to exclude yourfelf from all human fociety ; you will, I imagine, keep up your connection with the amiable Plastow ; I shall then hear from you how thefe happy lovers proceed ; for furely they muft be happy in the certainty of their being fo exceedingly dear to each other. It is to be hoped, alfo, that Lord Ashbourne, when he has thoroughly fixed his inclination upon an object fo capable of preferving his heart, will find no defire to change a fecond time. : a .man of fo fickle a difpofition would not be worth any woman’s notice.

Bell, I could laugh at your ignorance ; but, to be fure, a womans’ whom a sine young fellow has left for another handfome girl, and a woman who is adored, and doated on by the faithfullest and fondest hushand in the world, cannot feel the farne fenfations. It is by totally mistaking the word happinefs that you look at me in a light fp very different to that in which you ought to behold me.

situation is, in truth, the most amiable one to be conceived.
Felicity, my dear Bell, does not consist entirely in magnificence rnd parade, riches and fplendour will never give that heart-felt joy, to be enjoyed only in the fociety of thofe whom we love ; and as for the joy which Jhe feels with the man ho whom file is, of all her fex, the dearest, who fpends every hour of his life with her, and in studying to pleafe her, is beyond expreffion — Frankland is that man, that hushand to me. I chofe him, at sirst, for the elegance of his perfon, the gracefulnefs of his manners, the brightness of his understanding, and the virtues of his heart; I have no reafon to repent of my choice : I have a thouSand reaSons Sor defending it: his reSpectSul tenderneSs, his disinterested

In Such a pompous style oS living, I should' appear to little better advantage than the Lady in the Lobster ; and as to a great number oS Servants, every body knows they are the most troubleSome appendixes to grandeur.
So far, my dear, I hope I have convinced you, that the want of the luxuries of life, or of a taste to enjoy them, are no wants with me. I enjoy every ra-^ tional pleafure with my Frankland, and the highest of all delights in being fo C 6	sincerely.

In short, Deshorough, I am fo inexpressibly blest that I can fcarce sind time—I am fure I cannot sind words—to defcribe the fuL nefs of my joy.—May it be but as permanent, as it is exquisite ! May but my angel be preferved from illnefs, from every kind of danger ! Oh ! it is utterly impossible for me to paint the happinefs which it is in her power alone to confer upon me ! Ail my fear is, that I shall never, even with my most unwearied

wearied endeavours, be able to repay her for the tendernefs she lavishes on me : the fweet creature, however, appears to be delighted with every thing I fay or do, and cannot fee a single failing among the thoufand which I feel in myfelf, but of which I was not fenfible till I became fo intimately connected with fo a perfect woman. Long had I sighed for a companion ; yet little did I ever expect to meet with one fo every way desirable, fo infinitely beyond my fondest hopes. The greatest fatisfaction, even tranfport, indeed, she difcovers at every thing about her; though our manner-of living is fo very different to that which she has ever been accustomed : she takes a real delight in the management of her domestic affairs, and thofe affairs take up no fmall part of the morning: the rest of the day is dedicated

How many times have I read over your last letter, my poor Bell! how many times have I felt the sincerest pity for your mistaken notions of happi-nefs !—But you cannot, I know, help thinking as you do, at prefent:—I, poffibly, once entertained fentiments of a similar nature, though I believe I never carried them to the extravagant height; you do. However, you cannot, as I faid before, help it. I can only be forry that it is not in my power to make you as happy as myfelf: but the highest rank, the most affluent circumstances, the richest jewels, or the most magnifi-cenf palace, with all the dazzling et e^~ tera you can think of, will make you fo,

[Inclofed in the Soregoing.]
I Should have fooner Sent my congratulations to your Ladyship upon your marriage—a marriage entered into with the most aufpicious omens—had I not been exceedingly distreffed by the departure oS Lord Ashbourne, He has
1
taken his final leave of your poor LouiSa ; he has taken leave oS her Sor ever..
I am thoroughly convinced, indeed, of the propriety oS his behaviour; but I. cannot help lamenting the necessity of it, with the most poignant concern. Had.
Lord Ashbourne and I been perfonally acquainted with each other fooner,, we might now have been as happy as we-are otherwife at preSent, and as we are likely to remain: for I really think he

The Disinterested Marriage. 4S
loves me too fincerely to marry any other woman. Yet the tendernefs and the constancy of his passion, instead of giving me any fatisfaction, only ferve to make me regret his lofs with a more hopelefs forrow. I shall never forget the moment of our feparation. My Lord forgot his dignity, his rank, and every thing but his love, which feemed to increafe at' the very instant it ought to have been entirely given up. As for me, 1 was utterly incapable of conquering my own feelings, doubly pained by obferving the operations of htf. I cannot sind words strong enough to defcribe what I endured when he put a parchment into my hand, telling me, at the fame time, that it contained the writings belonging to my estate—“I resign it to “ you for ever,” continued he; “hoping, “ and fervently wishing, that whenever
“ you
44 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ you difpofe of your much more valii-“ able felf, you will meet with a man “ who has a just fenfe of your merit, “ and who feels a paffion for you not y lefs ardent than mine.”
In this manner he addressed himfelf to me, but he could hardly fpeak his words intelligibly.
On my bursting into a stood of tears, he stopped short, just when he was going to leave me, and faid, with the most dejected air imaginable, “ Nay, Mifs “ Plastow, if you weep, I cannot go “ from you.” He then fat down by me, and faid fo many foothing things, that I began to sind my fpirits greatly relieved. On a fudden, recollecting the indifcretion of which I was guilty, by listening to his melodious voice, I rofe
precipi-

precipitately—“ You forget, my Lord, “ that we are to part.”
“ I had, indeed, my Louifa,” replied he; “ for mine I fee you ever “ will be; that is, I am certain you “ will never give your hand to another “ man, though I must not poffefs fo in-“ estimable a bleshng.”
“ Never, my Lord ; never,” anfwered I: “ never will I give my hand “ to any man—”
“ Except me,” added he, catching it eagerly to his lips.
Only think. Lady Lucy, how much this foftening behaviour increafed my distrefs! How hard was it to drive him away from me at the moment I was most

fensible of his love ! I believe we should not have feparated at all, had not Mr. Ellis come in : he knew, I fancy, how it was; and thought that the longer we were together, the more difficult it would be for us to part. On his coming in he afked my Lord a trisling question about the chaife at the door ; de-fignedly, I fuppofe, to remind him that it waited for him. At that time I thought Mr. Ellis’s appearance impertinent ; I am now fatissied that he ap» peared with a very benevolent intention, to fpare us the affliction of another private adieu. My Lord, however, stood lingering, and looking as if he wanted to See Mr. Ellis walk away ; but he, re-gardleSs of his signisicant looks. Sat down, and Seemed not in the least diSpoSed to quit the room.—My Lord then, finding him immoveable, roSe, bowed to him, I	took

took my hand again, preffed it to his, Fetched a deep sigh, aand hurried from me without turning his eye once towards me.
As foon as my Lord was gone, fearful of Mr. Ellis’s faying any thing to me, though inadvertently, to increafe my grief, I ran up stairs, and remained in my own apartment, to indulge it, the rest of the day.—I was totally unsit for company. In the evening I received a letter from my Lord, dated from Dover, where he waited for a wind. Never was there, certainly, fuch a letter written by a man to a woman whom he was to relinquish for ever. He made a thoufand apologies for writing, declaring that he was not master of himSelf—that he could not rest till he had, with his pen, taken a more tender, pasiionate

adieu than he had dared to take in per-» fon.
I sighed, and could not—simpleton as I am—help exprcsiing, in an anfwer, a thoufand things which I alfo could not articulate when we parted. I received an inconceivable pleafure from the communication of my thoughts upon paper, for the sirst and last time.—As he was not then married, I ventured to indulge myfelf in this piece of folly, which I was the more eager to commit, not having been able to express what I had felt on his resigning all his power over me— •Flis resignation ofir, indeed,pained me the more, as I could not bear to be deferted by him, nor to sind the man to whofe care my father left me, fo ready to give nte up.—I told him, therefore, that I would return the writings (as I did not

choofe to be my own mistrefs) and continue under his protection, whether he was married or single as my continuance under it could not be injurious to the Ladv wdiom he made his wife : con-eluding, with affuring him that I would teo nothing without his advice and approbation.
Whether he approves of what I have done, I cannot tell; but this I know, my heart is lighter since I have laid it entirely open to his inspection ; for, tho’ I were certain never to fee him again, I should be exceedingly miferable to have my conduct deServing oS his cenfure. No, I would study every thing which would, I think, pleaSe him, were we to meet. This will be all the confolation I dare hope Sor; and with this, after having wished him every kind oS feli-

LETTER XLII.
Mrs. Stanley to Mrs. Forbes.
I A M got hither at lash after having had a tolerable feafon at Brighthelm-stone. Sir George, though a lover of pleafure, is not fo eager in the purfuit of it as many men are who appear lefs fond of it: he is likely, however, to sind amufement which he did not in the least expect.
One of the finest, handSomest fellows in the world is come to live here upon his own little estate.—The arrival of fuch a man, you will fay, cannot give any great entertainment to my brother: but this elegant fellow, elegant he C in every reSpeei:, has ran away with a young woman of quality, the most ami-D 2	able
52 The Disinterested Marriage.
able creature in the univerfe, as Sir George tells me, for I have not yet feen her, though he teafes me to death to go and visit her. Now I have no ob-jection at all to the hushand, but what shall I do with the wife? One handfome woman is always in the way of another, Sir George, indeed, is very ready to take her off the hands of us both ; yet, by all accounts, she not only married out of pure disinterested love : she has been married above six weeks, and is not tired of her hushand : on the contrary, she rather grows fonder of him: and as fgr him, they fay, (for every woman in the place fets her^cap at him) that he loves no body except his wife. Poor things! they will know better by and by, it is to be hoped. I was married near three weeks to Mr. Stanley, before I found him out, for I
was
The Disinterested Marriage. 53
was a mere child, and monstroufiy ignorant. The moment, however, I faw he began to grow tired, I became as weary as himfelf, and we both took our feparate pleafures with the greatest eafe imaginable. After all, Charlotte, theSe men are immenSely stupid; they complain of the ikentiouSneSs of the women, when they themSelves are entirely to blame. Only consider siov/ exceedingly weak it is, and foolish,for a man to marry a young creature, to be vaftly fond of her for a little time, and after that, never to trouble himSelf any more about her than if she was his grandmother. She, just come to the knowledge of her beauty, and the power naturally arising from that beauty, after having been initiated into the most plea-furable fcenes which she is capable of enjoying, is fuddenly, when her huf-D 3	band’s
54 The Disinterested Marriage.
band’s appetite is fatiated, thrown aside, never to be regarded any more with the fmallest degree of fatisfaction by him; by the only man from whom she has reafon to expect happinefs; the man whom she has fworn to love, honour, and obey. Such was my situation with Mr. Stanley, whofe infoience and indifference foon made me have for him the greatest aversion and contempt. But 1 have no hopes of making any thing of this Frankland, fo vastly is he attached to one woman, whom he, with equal justice and constancy, I must ov/n, prefers to all her fex. By the way though, there is fomething strangely gothic in their conjugal behaviour: I commend it indeed, but I think it, notwithstanding, very awkward and unfashionable : it is not, in short, according to the ton of the times. It is a pity
that
The Disinterested Marriage. 55
that Frankland, of all men, should be lb constant a creature: were his tenderneSs not So confined, were he as sickle as the majority of his Sex, his tenderneSs might be diffusive enough to make a hundred women extremely happy. I have lately, I own, looked upon constancy as the certain mark oS a narrow mind, and think that there is Something infinitely more noble in rnakino- our af-Sections as extenSue as our acquaintance. 1 dare Say Sir George is of my opinion ; but whether wc shall ever prevail on theSe new neighbours to adopt our Sentiments upon this Subject, is another matter, and by time only to be decided. Whenever I am able to give you farther information about it, you shall hear again from

Sir George would not let me have a moment’s peace till I went to fee this Ijady Lucy Frankland; and what was still more provoking, he would go with me.

(What strange people ! How differently do they behave from married people in general!) Never did I fee fo perfectly

Sir George, however, —thefe men you know, Charlotte, al-v/ays fee more than other folks, often fee indeed what is not to be feen—Sir George fays she is the most beautiful creature that ever existed. She has certainly a je ne ffoi quci about her, which pleaSes even me; and that is faying a great deal; for we sine women commonly have an aversion to each other: and it is very natural for us- to have a mutual aversion, as there is not, I tfare believe, a single foul among us, who would not be glad to make a conquest over all the tolerable fellows who fall in our way. Now whenever women interfere in the purfuit of the fame de-D 5	Signs,

signs, they muSc of courSe hate each each other most cordially. After all, there is fomething fo insinuating, fo agreeable in this Lady Lucy, that one cannot help being pleafed with her, in fpite of one’s reaSon.
“ Tell me what she is like—how she “ looked — what she Said —what she “ had on.”
She IS neither tall nor short; neither fair nor brown; neither fat nor lean; she is of a moderate height,of a pleasing size, and of a clear complexion. Her hair is dark, part of it is combed up, and part of it hangs carelefslyover her forehead,giving an half archneSs, an half innocent, picturefque air to her face, which is neither long nor round. She has an agreeable shape, and a pair of fmiling eyes, under the finest

The Disinterested Marriage. 59
long eye-lashes I ever beheld : her lips are red and pouting, her teeth white, but irregular; her neck, bofom and hands, are remarkably white and delicate. So much for her perfon. She was dressed in a white lustring nightgown ; her linen was clear musiin, with a sine Bruffels point edging : she had a pink petticoat, and pink ribbons: her cap was fmall, and particularly elegant, though rather too infantile for an un-dreSs: it became her, however; and a woman of taste ought only to confult the becoming when she looks in her glass. This white neck was decently and gracefully covered, not with a twisted tippet, like a shein of thread, but with a sinall, well made handkerchief, which difcovered and concealed beauties. Sir George faid, at the fame time : but men have unaccountable ways of expressing D 6	them-

themfelves : yet, to be fure, take her all together, she is an agreeable sigure, and has a manner, a* fpirit in her converfation, which forces your attention, whether you will or not. She has, indisputably, enchanted her huS-band, to whoSe perSon I delpair of do-ing justice. To Say that he is tall, and genteelly formed, is to Say nothing; and it is impossible for me to defcribe the extreme gracefulnefs of his whole appearance ; his excessive eafe, and the elegance of every particular miove-•ment—his hair—his teeth—^his eyes— there is no looking at his eyes—fo brilliant are they—they fparkle when he is- talking to any indifferent people; but the tenderest languor fwims in them when they are fixed upon her who feems to engage all his thoughts. He is very polite indeed to every body, but he is

attached, it may be truly faid, to her alone. In short, I was foon Ikk of being considered only as the fecond sigure in the piece. I had never a great idea, of being the confidmte of lovers, and 1 really could fee myfelf in no other light, as Lady Lucy appeared to be the only woman in the room. Her man is, quite intoxicated with love and joy, and my wife brother feemed to be as much charmed as the doating hushand : he was fo remarkably assiduous about her, that she blushed more than once^
J, who never want fomething to fay,
. expressed my apprehensions of her wanting amufement during the winter months, or in their dusl, stupid village.— ^ He replied, “ No, Madam, Lady Lucy “ has a fund of entertainment within “ herfelf: she is very musical, and “ draws in a very sine taste.”<—“ Pray,
“ my

“ my dear,” added he, rising, and going up to her with a befeeching air in his charming eyes, “ oblige Mrs. Stanley “ with a sight of your bracelet.”—She fmiled confent; he then took off her glove as gently as if he was afraid of hurting her, and unfastened a string of pearls, to which his picture hung, of her own painting. It was very prettily done; but fuch a pair of eyes would almost infpire the blind. She has kept up all the fpirit of the original, and made him even languish on her with her pencil.
Sir George was, as he is apt to be, in raptures, and fwore that it must be transporting to fit to her. I declare I thought I made a mighty silly sigure, while the two men, entirely taken up
with
The Disinterested Marriage. 63
with her, did not appear to know that I was in the room.
When my brother could be prevailed on to part with his toy, Frankland would not let Lady Lucy replace it on her arm herfelf. Sitting down by her, he was a long time fiddling about her; and presied her arm fo warmly to his bofom, that I began to think he wished us out of the way. She read what I thought, I fancy, and blushed fo amazingly, that her doating hushand let her hand go, and looked as if he was fearful of having difpleafed her by detaining it fo long. His eyes were then hardly off her a moment. He alked her, repeatedly, if she vras well, and offered to bring another chair for her, imagining her feat was uneafy to her. She declined his offer in the most
obliging
si4 The Disinterested Marriage.
obliging manner. Sir George indeed, told me, when we came home, that the fweetneSs of her behaviour had made him wish himfelf, a thoufand times, in the poffession of fuch a woman. In: short, Lady Lucy has. turned my brother’s head, and Frankland has turned mine. As for them., they, at prefent,.^ are too much wrapped up in each other, to bestow a look on us. How they may feel, before the winter is half over, 1 cannot tell: they may, by that time, begin to wish that they had fome tolcr rable neighbours. I am already almost, moped to death. Sir George frequently throws himfelf acroSs a couple of chairs,, and sighs out “ Divine Lucy,” a hundred times a day. To conclude : thefe disinterested lovers, as they are called by people who know fomething of their story, torment m.e exceedingly; and if

66 The Disinterested M^RRiAGEr-
Sir George Cashwel and his sister Mrs.-Stanley are by any means diSagreeable themfelves : the former is a man of understanding and elegance, and the latter is a handSome, lively young widow. Their acquaintance, however, does not at all coincide with our plan. The quiet conversation of the rector now and then, and the Sober, civil chat of his wife, with a few How d’ees given and returned by fome of the best fort of farmers and their families,, and questions-about corn and cattle, at market, are quite fufficient Sor us rusticks. People oS Sashion and taste are, by no means,, proper companions Sor us; they are, indeed, the only people we would avoid ; but I fee it: is impossible : the Gentleman and the Lady are, both, likely to be exceedingly troubleSome.

but what attracts his sister I am at a lofs to imagine. However, they are perpetually coming after us ; and by fo doing very much interrupt, very much disturb us: it is really quite difagreeable to my deareSt girl, who is not in a situation to bear fatigue. We have acquainted them with our design to live in the most private manner; but Sir George thinks that a parti quarree is more eligible for us than a tete a tete; and as to Mrs. Stanley, Jhe cannot endure retirement at all.—We laugh, ourfelves, at our unfashionable taste, and look grave at thofe who would rally us out of it; but all to no purpofe : they will not Jet us enjoy ourfelves in our own way: we love walking; when my dear Lucy is weary, I take her up in my Italian chair, which one horfe will draw with fufficient velocity ; but as Sir George thinks no carriage

riage sit to step into that does not require two horfes, he is continually calling in his phaeton, and endeavouring to perfuade my wife to let him carry her here and there; yet he never can prevail on her to put herfelf under his care. He fends us fruit, game, and nofegays which are uncommonly elegant for the leafon ; but we had rather not be under any obligations to him. My Lucy is, 1 thank heaven, thoroughly fatissied with what it is in my pov/er to procure for her: while Jhe is pleaSed, I cannot be unhappy; though I should be more pleaSed were 1 not So pestered with people who cannot, at preSent, be Suitable to us : nor will they indeed, I believe; ever be So. Mrs. Stanley is much too sine a Lady to pleaSe me, and Sir George has too much of the man of Sashion about him to charm my wife, who prefers her
rustic
The Disinterested Marriage. 69
rustic Charles to all the pretty fellows in the univerfe. It has ever been my opinion, that a man stands a far greater chance of being plagued than pleafed by his neighbours; and therefore it is best to have no connection with them. —My Lucy wants my assistance—-I will conclude by and by.
In Continuation.
It was not my wife to whom I was called ; she, it feems was just gone to visit a poor cottager, at a little distance, who lies in with twins, and to whom her purfe, as well as fympathising heart, has been for fome time open. When I came into the parlour, I found Mrs. Stanley, reclined on the fofa, in the most inviting attitude you can imagine,
with
yo The Disinterested Marriage.
with her head fupported by her hand, and one foot dangling over the other ; both of which were siightly covered with the prettiest pair of flippers to be conceived. Her neck, really very white, and well turned, was half-concealed, half-expofed to my obfervation, by the negligent air with which the handkerchief defigned for it was thrown afide. Instead of rifing at my entrance, as I naturally fuppofed file would, she only just lifted up her eyes with a languishing fmile, and faid, “ Lord, Mr. Frankland, “ I wanted to fee Lady Lucy—As the “ horfes were not put to the chaife, I “ attempted to walk : shut, though it “ is a little way, you cannot imagine “ how much I am tired : I am really “ fcarce able to move : and ail this fa-“ tigue now is to no purpoSe, as my y Lady is not at home, I find.”
4	Such
The Disinterested Marriage. 71
Such attitudes, fuch glances, and fuch an addrefs, required a fuitable anfwer ; but I am become perfectly dead to every thing in petticoats, my wife excepted. I therefore told her that Lady Lucy was gone out for the afternoon, and had not the gallantry to desire her to stay to keep me company. She was indeed almost neceshtated to take her leave, as I did not once sit down, though her eyes, and every part of her behaviour, strongly invited me, but ctood as if I wished her, impatiently, to retreat.
Finding she could make nothing of me, she rofe, at last, yet roSe very feebly, as if she was lame, stretching out her hand, at the fame time, to catch at fomething for her fupport: yet my hand
offered
72 The Disinterested Marriage.
offered not to give her the least assistance.
“ Lord blefs me ! ” cried she, iettins herfelf fall again on the fofa, “ I do not “ think it poffible for me to walk ; and “ yet I muft return—Will you be sh “ obliging. Sir,” 'added she, “ wkh a look and tone, which were, I dare fay, in her opinion, irresistible, “ will you be “ fo obliging as to fee me fafe back ? “ I brought no fervant with me, and I “ am really afraid I shall not be able to ‘‘ go by mySelf.”
Still I made no reply. I stood in a posture of taking leave, ready to return to my grounds, where I expected to meet my Lucy, who went out at the garden door. I was quite mistaken, however; she was determined to make
me
The Disinterested Marriage. 73
me attend her, whether I would or not; for getting up a fecond time, she caught hold of me, and faid, “ I am forry to “ be fo troubleSome, Mr. Frankland ; “ but indeed I cannot walk without “ leaning on Somebody.”
Still I hung back, telling her that it would be better for her to Send for her chariot, though I dreaded the delay which the fending for it would occasion: but my fcheme was unfucceSsful: there was no shaking her off: she clung as clofe as if I hadfaved her from drowning; and I was, at length, forced to accompany her, merely to get rid of her.
Thus you fee how exceedingly impertinent the politest people, the best neighbours, may be.

I SHOULD be the happiest creature in the world, were there no impertinent people in it.
We have a Sir George Cafwell and

which is not far from ours : would it \
was an hundred miles off. Their acquaintance is by no means desirable, quite otherwife indeed. They are, at sirst sight, agreeable enough ; but v/c must not, we cannot judge by appearances : they are extremely deceitful— yet, had we never been deceived, Frankland and I should have contracted intimacies with the greatest circumfpection.

7si . The. Disinterested Marriage.
There are fome people indeed who will not be kept at a distance ; Sir George is a man of this cast. I should not, however, mind his encroachments, were I not afraid that my^ dear Charles should be drawn into a quarrel on my account. When I think of that, I actually tremble, and about fo foolish an affair too,. Having been to give a little advice, and a little money, to a poor tenant, who rents a cottage at the back of our ground, I met, on my return home. Sir George. He told me he had been waiting for my coming out, from the time he faw me go in. I replied, that he had given himfelf a great deal of un-neceffary trouble ; adding, that I did not know he could have any businefs with me.— “ The fame businefs,” anfwered he, “ which all who See you “ have—to admire you.” Then, throw-4	ing
The Disinterested Marriage. 77
ino; his arm round me, he began to take fome very unbecoming freedoms.
I broke from him immediately, and was hurrying home as fast as possible : he feized my hand, and putting it under his arm, Squeezed it cloSely ; declaring,-at the fame time, that he would take care of me, and carry me in his arms, ' rather than Suffer me to walk too Sar.— Provoked at this excessive familiarity, I pulled my brind away with violence, and told him I did not understand Such behaviour ; but he fvore I should not leave ' him in anger, riming into a conversation not at all fit for my hearing ; a conversation which would have been highly disagreeable to me, had not my heart been immoveably fixed. I was now' quite angry with him : I struggled, and, at length, diSengaged mySeiS from him ; but he, fomehov/, contrived to kifs me E 3	before
yS ■ The Disinterested Marriage.
before I could entirely shake him off.
His last impertinence roufed my indignation to fuch a degree, that I hardly knew what I faid to him. I only know I came home fo very much difconcerted, that my dear Frankland was quite a-larmed at my appearance : he has been anxious about me ever since : he is, indeed, the kindest, best of men: I ^ always thought i should be happy with him, but never could have conceived the felicity which I enjoy. I have entirely brought Mrs. Selby to approve of my marriage, though she was at sirst extremely averfe to it. She informs me that my cousin Harry Menel is perfectly recovered, and that he is going to be married to a Lady who has been fome time at Montpelier with her father, whom she accompanied for the restoration of his health. I sincerely wish that
he

You will wonder perhaps that I, who have been brought up fo totally ignorant of every thing relating to thefe fituations, should have any knowledge of the motherly kind. To dell' you the truth, Mrs. Bowen, the Rector’s wife, who feems to be the best fort of woman in the world, is insinitely fervice-able to me with her knowledge. She has taught me how to cut out and make every thing neceffary for the approaching occasion, which employs me very agreeably.

To what purpofe should I wish to change my situation ? I declare I cannot conSent to it. I would rather die than be Separated from my Frankland, or See him on my account— for he had a genteel fufficiency when I married him—driven from his native land ; from his own Small, yet well cultivated, paternal estate, to a clime which must, undoubtedly, be very diSagreeable to him—and very pernicious too—

I shudder at the thoughts of it, and have, by the earnestnefs of my intreaties, prevailed on him to refufe an offer which, but for my fake, for the fake of rendering my situation more af-fiuent, he never would have thought of accepting. Fle is the kindest, the most indulgent of men, and, till this talk of a Separation, never has occasioned me a moment’s uneasineSs.
I have been a good deal perSecuted by this impertinent Sir George: and I Suffer the more from his impertinence, as I am obliged to conceal it from my Frankland, lest he should—as I am certain he would^—correct him. He hardly lets me have a minute’s rest: he follows me every where; he pesters me

From this quarter, I imagine, the offer of the place comes; as he thinks that I cannot venture upon fuch a voyage, and that Mr. Frankland must leave England as foon as he accepts of his West Indian appointment. I hope, however, that he never will, on any account listen to it. Yet I cannot help being apprehensive that a mistaken teiiw dernefs for me may prompt him to take a step for the, fuppofed, increafe of my happinefs, which will render us both very miferable.

I have gone as Sar as I well could, without absolutely exposing mySelf: he is inSensible to me; yet he by no means wants either understanding or penetration, and I do not care to be an object of contempt and ridicule to a man who, in Spite oS his neglect, commands esteem and refpect Srom every woman.

He may Sancy himSelf as handSome as Frankland, but he is vastly mistaken; they are not to be mentioned at the Same, time; it would be the idlest thing in the world to make a comparison between them.

This playful girl really amufes—without her company, indeed, I should pafs many a lonely hour, as 1 am deprived, in a great mea-fure, of the converfation of my wife, who can make herfelf amends by caressing

resting our dear little boy, when I am not permitted to be with her. At fuch times Maria diverts me either with her lively chat, or her melodious voice,, or her mufical instruments. She sings in a very pathetic style to her guittar; and fometimes I, at her desire, accompany her on the harpsichord: but all her arts, though they are, I believe, very innocent ones, cannot draw me a single moment from my amiable,, my valuable Lucy ; a thoufand times more valuable by being the mother, the nurfe of my fon.—She fends for me.

I only told him, in reply then, that I would acquaint Lady Lucy wkh the honour he designed her.’—When I did acquaint her with ir, she begged I would not think of admitting Sir George upon fuch an occasion, upon any occasion indeed, faying, that by being godfather, he would have a pretence for being continuafly in the houfe, and that we should never get rid of him. — “ Flowever,” added she, “ as ‘‘ he has conSerred what is generally “ esteemed a great favour on us, we “ cannot affront him.”

“ Alk Mr. Bowen at once,” faid she,

I complied with alacrity. I hurried to my friend the Rector, and intreated him to stand for my boy.

“ I am afraid,” Said he, “ that Sir “ George may Be ostended wirh me: I “ have no intention, indeed, to court “ his favour; but I would not willingly “ affront any of my parishioners.”

Tell me now. Lady Lucy, is there any thing fo very extravagant in what Lord Ashbourne has propofed ? Would he not act very unlike a man of honour, by pretending to love one woman, when his whole Soul is devoted to another ? Lady Bell Wallace Surely cannot be happy with a man who freely

Are you not of my opinion, dear Lady Lucy ? And do you not esteem Lord Ashbourne for this charmingopennefs of temper? He * 'Will not deceive either Lady Bell or me. I own I cannot but be pleafed with a conduct that must be thought laudable by every disinterested ' perfon.

Yesterday
The Disinterested Marriage. 131
Yesterday a very genteel post-chaife and four drove up to our door. Such an equipage, Deshorough, does not often appear before our humble habitation. Out jumped as genteel a young fellow as I have feen for fome time. He introduced himfelf by faying, that though he had not the honour of being perfonally acquainted with me, he was happy in being known to Lady Lucy. After having made a polite enquiry after her health, and her little fon’s, he added, that his name was Fanshaw; that he was a near neighbour of Mrs. Selby’s; and that he had promifed her to pay his refpects to Lady Lucy and me in his way to London, being on the point of fetting out for Paris ; to which place he should be very ready to carry any of her Ladyship’s commands, or mine.	,	. O

132 The Disinterested Marriage.
I recollected immediately that this must be tlie very man of whom I had been fo apprehensive before my dearest girl would confent to be united to me by the strongest ties: and as he again affured me that he was in haste to leave England, I readily conducted him to my wife. He behaved to her with a refpectful kind of friendship which could not but be very pleasing. He caressed my boy more than once, wished that he was his; and added, that, in order to bring him as near him as possible, he should be extremely glad to be his godfather: he then produced a letter from Mrs. Selby, wherein she communicated to Lady Lucy her design to be his godmother.
My dear Lucy looked at me for my approbation, and received it directly..

As Mr. Fanshaw’s stay here, then, must be very short, I beg you will be with me to-morrow ; you shall return as foon as you pleafe: let me tell you, however, that you must not expect any other entertainment than fuch as farmers ought to give. I am quite pleafed that it is in my power to refufe Sir George, without making Mr. Bowen uneafy, who will now perform the ceremony instead of his curate. I could have afked Harry Swymmer; but though both he and his sister appeared willing to forward my union with Lady Lucy, they have not since behaved in the most agreeable manner: they are, both of them, too much attached to the world, and all its parade and nonfenfe, not to think that Lady Lucy and I might have been much happier, might have acted, at least, much wifer, by giving up, what

It is her own heavenly temper which makes her fo contented with me, fo pleafed with every thing about her.

We were, a few evenings ago, in a itte a tete party by accident; as neither of us thought of contriving fuch an in* terview; and, indeed, both feemed equally puzzled how to fupport a con-'Verfation that was fufficiently languid on j«y side, and very much interrupted on his side by sighs and monofyllables. I fat knotting in a carelefs attitude; he '	fat

fat playing with a bouquet, which, for want of fomething elfe, he had taken out of his bofom : yet he every now and then cast a siy look at me, as if he was afraid of being caught in doing what he should not : at length, after having pushed out the profoundest sigh you ever heard, and laying down his flowers, while his eyes and all his attitudes appeared to implore my pity, he addreffed me in the following manner:— “ I have,
“ for fome time, Lady EsU, ever since “ my return, indeed, wished to open “ my heart to you : but shame, fear—
“ and a number of contending passions,
“ in short, added to the confeiouSneSs I “ felt of making a very ridiculous, if not “ a very cenfurable appearance in your “ eyes, have hitherto kept me silent: but “ my silence has cost me fo much, that I “ must now give a vent to my feelings,

sinement; but the gentle girl remov-ed my terrors, with the mildest, most encouraging complacency, and raffed my hopes to a pitch far beyond my expectations. Filial obedience, a “ most affectionate attention, at leash “ to the commands of a tender parent, though not existing, considerably prompted her, I will venture to fay, “ to wish for an alliance with the man “ whom he had chofen for her, and for whom, though in a manner unknown, “ she-had, in opposition .to numerom “ Solicitations, reServed herfelf. Was it “ poffible Sor me.

“ or not; but Mifs Plastow,” added he, vfith the most inSolent rapture fparkling in his eyes, “ must ever poffefs my ten-“ derest love.”
Here he ceafed fpeaking. — I had been prepared for all this: I had even wished to have it over; yet I looked like a fool; I actually did not, at sirst, know what to fay to him. 1 was not in ^ love with him, however — Surely, fo frank a difcovery of his fentiments was fufficient to cure me of the prepostessons I had entertained in his favour: but I am afraid that few women, if any.

Refolving, indeed, to put the best face 1 could upon the matter, I, with a fort of a forced

“ which might not have happened, had “ not our connection been on the point “ of diffolution.”
He

He looked at me as if he did not, or would not, understand me; and, by this time, I thought I had been rather too flippant. I really began to feel for him, and thought his fituation was an uncommonly awkward one. I, therefore, treated him with the utmost franknefs ; told him, that I had for fome time known his inclination for Mifs Plastow, and had only waited for the intelligence from himfelf; adding, that T had alfo heard she was very amiable, and that I fincerely wished him happy with her.
This change in my behaviour produced an instantaneous one in his Lord-ship. Icte feized my hand with almost as much tranfport as if it had been his Louifa’s, called me generous, noble creature, and begged I would grant him, VoL. II.	H	if

if I could ever restore him to my good opinion, my friendship; which it should be his perpetual study to deferve.
I told him,I would, provided he, in return, would procure me the friendship of the Lady in question.
I ashed nothing more of him: he promifed to comply with my request, faying, that Mifs Plastow had too much fenfe, too much difeernment, to refufe me. Fle will now, 1 fuppofe, make all possible haste to England, in order to complete the happinefs of the lovely Plastow.
And now, my dear Lucy, do you not pity me' for the ioSs of this sickle fellow ?' His behaviour to me would deter foshe women from ever listening to

I CANNOT sit down to write to you, without repeating my own thanks and Lady Lucy’s, for your kindness in being godfather to my little Charles. 1 could abfoJutely make myfelf ridiculous, by expatiating in the pretty fellow’s praiSe.

draw me from my Lucy. I thought indeed, at sirst sight of her, that she had fomething about her which did not thoroughly accord with the affected simplicity of her behaviour : young however, pleasing to an uncommon degree, and eager to render herSelf engaging, she allures the eye, and sixes the attention, before you can be aware of the miSchief she may do you. Fortunately, 1 found her out time enough to be upon my guard: I always fancied she was particularly bufy about, me: I would not willingly indulge a cenfurable vanity ; but she really appeared to be entirely indifereet; more fo, at leash than any girl of character ought to be : yet I confefs I was taken in by her affected naivete, and mistook all her art for na-^ ture. She was ever very assiduous to pleaSe me beSore Lady Lucy’s consine-H 3	ment;

ment; when she was fafe in her bed, she then began to shew herfelf, but in a gradual manner.—Now, as the trying of a sine girl naturally attracts the attention cf the most infensible man, 1 own I was Sometimes tempted to trifle with her again, though I actually meant to do So most innocently : she drew me on, however, by permitting me to take one liberty after another, till 1 became almost intoxicated with the pleasing folly. I forgot every thing, except my dear, my ever-loved Lucy : I never lost sight of her-, foe was ever prefent to my imagination: her image rofe to my m.ind in all the dignity of virtuous tendernefs, when I was most in danger from this feducing girl. — While she hung over me one day, in the playfullest attitude imaginable, one hand being thrown across my shoulder, the other

wantonly employed sin turning a ringlet of my hair, I started up, and pushed her hastily from me, just when her lips were ready to meet mine. I hope I should have had as rnuch fortitude, if my heart had not been unalterably attached to my wife. I should, at any time, have deSpiSed mySelf for taking an improper advantage of ;unguarded, innocence.—-My fuppofed innocent companion, on my ’^iushing her from me, walked away immediately, without mov-her head towards me, ;and hurried out of the room. I then determined to shun her very carefully for the future.—1 did fo ; I kept from Mrs. Bowen’s- for Several days ; but as sh© frequently called upon my wife, I could not avoid feeing her.—I behaved to her, however, with great reSdrve: at firsts she affeOted not to perceive the change^ in my carriage, H 4	and

and renewed her former familiarities ^ Vet finding they would not do, she grew ferious; dejected indeed, though her visits to me were more frequent. Still I took no other notice of her than what common civility required.
My Lucy now quitted her apartment, and fat in the parlour as ufual. Mifs Waters came and brought her v/ork.
Flaving been at play one morning with my boy, Maria, who fat looking at us, attempted to attract my attention, by caressing the child : but as I chofe to let her fee that I would not encourage any farther freedoms, I gave my boy to his mother, took my hat, and walked into the garden. She followed me instantly. I let her fee that I wished to avoid her, but she purfued
m.e.,

me. When I came to the part of my grounds from which, you know, there is an opening to the meadows, 1 went out at the door, and was going to lock ' it after me, in order to fecure my retreat. — “Hold, Sir,” cried she, stopping me, with great agitation, “hear me a “ moment: it will be the last time I “ shall ever trouble you; but I cannot “ bear to leave you, while you harbour a bad opinion of me, though I am “ in fome shape deferving of cenfure.
“ I have been put upon acting a part,” added she, with a voice foftencd by her tears, ansi' still more agitated, “for “ which I now condemn myfelf^ as I “ am convinced of the folly, of the “ baSenefs of it; yet I hope you will “ pardon me, and not' think amifs of “ me, Mr. Frankland, when I stell yon,

Sit down for one quarter “ of an hour, and listen to a poor un-“ fortunate girl, whom your exemplary “ conduct will fave from additional in-“ famy—who is doomed, however, to fuffer for her past errors.”
\
I was astonished at this strange, unexpected preambie—I will not pretend, indeed, to tell you I had not, for fome time, believed that Maria looked on me with very favourable eyes ; but I was, I own, amazed to hear her fo freely declare her paffion for me : for me, a married man, and particularly attached to my wife. Astonished, however, as I
was.
The Disinterested Marriage. 155
was, I complied with her request, tho* I am fensible that I looked wonder. She began in the following manner:
“ When you sirst faw me at Mr, “ Bowen’s, Sir, you believed me to be “ what I once was, an innocent country “ girl: would to heaven I had always “ remained fo ! My father is a farmer “ in Leicestershire, a tenant of Sir “ George Cafwell’s. In taking a view “ one day of his estate in that county, “ he, unfortunately for me, faw me, “ and took a fancy to me. I was “ then very young (I am now but Seven-“ teen) and had feen very little of the “ world. I will however confefs, that “ though I was flattered by his sine “ fpeeches, I felt no particular incli-“ nation for him. I did not at that “ time know what love meant; I only H 6	“ wished
156 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ wished to be admired and caressed “ more than my companions. Sir George “ decoyed me from liome upon a party “ of pleafure, and, prevailed on me to “ drink a quantity of warm liquor af-“ ter dancing. There was certainly “ fomething infuSed into it; for my “ ideas were foon in a disordered state, “ and, in conSequence of that state, I “ was totally in the power of my fe-“ ducer. When I sirst discovered my “ unhappy* Situation, I raved, wept, “ and thought mySelf the most miSera-“ ble or human beings; but my un-“ doer found a way to Soothe and to “ calm me, by preScnts, and by a ten-“ derneSs, which, had it continued, “ would have made me more Satissied “ wsith my condition, though it never “ could have reconciled me to my fate; “ nor should I at sirst have listened to

“ him, had I not been afraid to go “ home to my father.—Refiecting, co-“ vered with shame, on what, was past, “ and dreading ill. treatment at home “ after my criminal proceeding, I con-“ fented to live with Sir George in the “ manner he desired; that is, in the “ most retired manner, in a Small village “ within a Sew miles of London. There “ 1 was gradually neglected by him;
but he furnished me wirh money “ enough Sor a genteel Subsistence, in “ a private way. In. that way indeed “ I was far from being happy, and my “ recollections were fufficiently painful “ to render me lefs So : yet I was afraid “ 10 quarrel with my fupporter, lest he “ should v/ithdraw his allowance. At “ last, however, I told him plainly, that “ I was tired of my situation, and that “ I imagined he would be glad to get

“ rid of me; adding, that he might “ easily do fo, if he would only con-“ fent to fettle on me, for my life, a “ quarter of what he at that tiirie al-“ lowed me: affuring him alfo, that I “ would go down into Leicestershire, “ and never trouble him again.

Here Maria clofed her little narrative —I was struck with a behaviour fo uncommon : perhaps I was flattered by the compliments she paid me. Where is the man proof against the insinuating wiles of the insinuating fex .? To fpeak the honest truth, I was not at all fatif-sied at finding mySelf fo pleafed with this. artful girl’s confeffion ; and yet my indignation against Sir George foon got the better of every other emotion. I told her that I should think no more of what was past—I meant her part of it—?• but she mistook my meaning, I believe, and imagined that I should refent Sir George’s behaviour; for she requested me, in the most pathetic terms, not to endanger my valuable life (as she called

She quitted

me with tears in her eyes, and I went .slowly towards the houfe.
On my return, I found my Lucy sitting in the parlour where I had left her: she looked, I imagined, unuSually Serious. My head too was Sull of what I had just heard. Taking her in my arms with a tenderneSs which I had not till tliat moment experienced, and pressing her lips to my Sace, I thought I Selt a pearly drop upon her cheek.
“ What’s the matter with my life faid I, looking anxioussy at her.

“ Give it vent then, my angel,” faid I, pressing her still clofer; my heart was full: I feared that I had, only by trilling with Maria, injured the best of creatures. I felt an indignation against the former, notwithstanding her pretended infatuation for me, which I could fcarcely fupprefs ; and 1 determined, one day, to make my wife acquainted with every thing. Just at that time, however, I fancied I should foften her too much. There was a tender kind of dejection in her countenance, which silled me with great anxiety of which I never had been before fensible. At times I could not help fancying that my anxiety was owing to my remorfe, Sor having trifled with this poor, unfortunate, weak girl: I really pity her, but I wish 1 had never Seen her. Flow much has Sir George to anSwer Sor, by having Seduced

I think, can be vindicated, who decoys an ignorant, innocent young creature from the peaceful situation, the happy fituation in which providence had placed her.—Had she not been deluded by him, she might have lived the darling of her parents, the delight of her friends, and the exemplary companion of her young female neighbours and acquaintance. What a cruel change has an abandoned libertine produced in the mind of this pitiable girl! how has he perverted her principles ! how has he corrupted her manners ! When he had, by the baSest of all methods, deprived her of her fenSes, he effectually excluded all resistance ; and when her perfon was once polluted, her mind was foon in a condition to receive any impreshon her leducer

The wonder is, that as Sir George kept her conti-nually^employed in an infamous manner, she ever recovered her former principles, and had refolution enough, fmote by repentance, not only to struggle with her contending passions, but to extricate herfelf from a state of life which would have certainly grown lefs and leSs tolerable had she remained in it.—Flatteringly, would she have made me believe that I was the caufe of her reformation, by treating her with a referve and a contempt which opened her eyes, and made her fee things in their proper colours. Happy shall I think myfelf, if I have been instrumental to her return to the humble situation from which she was drawn in a manner hardly to be forgiven : at the fame time, however, I I wish 1 had never trifled with her, as 4

I ought not to have given the siightest encouragement to Maria; I should not have' ventured to rifque my Lucy’s feeling a single moment’s uneasinefs, though I actually think that my dear Lucy has too much confidence in me, to have the Smallest Sulpicions concerning my fidelity to her: she has too much nobleneSs oS mind to be jealous of the man she has blest with her good opinion. Doubly blameable, therefore, should I be to deceive her. How I hate myfelf for mv folly! but it is now at an end: yet I have acted a foolish part, and I muft reflect on that part with forrow.

Sir George Caswell to Mr. Brander.
I Have been the most unlucky fellow in the world in my attack upon Lady Lucy, who has increaSed my passion for her by an uncommon resistance, and by Sentiments, if not new, rarely to be met with: Sentiments, indeed, So gre*at— though at the Same time So mortiSying— that I can hardly believe them to be real.
-1 told you of the plot I had laid for her, by placing Maria Waters at the Rector’s, in hopes oS detaching Frankland Srom his wife, whom I hoped to inSpire with reSentment, and to aid and assist in the gratification of it, and So I 2	forth—

They fay we fpoil them; but fome are certainly ready fpoiled to our hands. The following account of my late difappointment will ferve to give strength to this affertion. Having charged Maria to take every opportunity of being with Frankland, I chofe to, allow her time before I appeared myfelf, that Lady Lucy might not fufpect any connection between us. As luck would have it, when I came to Frankland he was not within : his charming wife was sitting in the parlour, employed with her needle. She hardly vouchfafed to rife at my entrance, but looked at me with the coolest indifference : that indifference provoked me, 4	perhaps,

perhaps, to fay more than I otherwife should have faid. When I had complimented her upon her recovery, L told her I was forry to fee her occupied in a manner fo unfuitable to her birth and
education.
.
“ My birth. Sir,” replied she, with a charming fpirit, “ ought not . to fet. “ me above my condition ; and every “ woman’s education ought to make her “ a ufeful wife and mother.”
“ What home-bred notions are thefe, “ Lady Lucy,” faid I, “ for a woman “ with your perfon, taste, and accom-“ plishments, to entertain !—But grant-“ ing that they are laudable in fome “ wives, they are abSurd in you ; as “ every charm, and every virtue you I 3	‘‘ ever

A glow of indignation flushed her cheek.

“ Floid, Madam,” faid I—“ stay a “ single moment—Whatever unjust ideas ” you may have formed of me, I do not, “ at preSent, merit them. I will ven-“ ture my life on what I am now going ‘‘ to tell you : The man for whom you

“ I receive no pleaSure,” replied she, with a kind of Sullen countenance at what I had told her, notwithstanding her affected unconcern ; “ I receive no “ pleaSure Srom any perSon’s flatteries : “ my only wish is, to deServe Mr. Frank-“ land’s affefHonsP
She then added, after a paufe, as if recollecting herfelf, “ And I doubt not “ but that I shall always fecure his “ ejleemP

I Spoke at random, but I actually thought that I guessed right; for she blushed, and hung her head a little while : then, raising it on a fudden, she faid, “ You may be very right.

With thefe words she hurried out of the room : and all my efforts to lure her back again were unfuccefsful.
Finding that she would not return, I went away, exceedingly hurt at not having been able to make the siightest impression upon her in my favour. She is really the-most extraordinary character I am acquainted with; few women, either wives or mistreffes, who attach themfelves fo constantly to a man; to a man who does not love them in return : Lady Lucy is, indeed, of a most amiable dilposstion, as well as exceedingly lovely in her perfon and manners. What a treafure is she to this Frankland ! He is very fond of her, I believe, though I have raifed all this dust about him. Who the devil would not doat on fuch a creature ? It is almost criminal to attempt to teaSe her by fuch a piece of I 5	vile

vile deceit as I have practifed ; yet, in love and in war, stratagems are fair. Besides, if I treat her with as much tendernefs as this Frankland does, she will lofe nothing by the change : one handSome young Sellow is as good as another, I imagine; and most women think So : but this charming woman differs as much from her fex, by her strange perverSenefs, as by her perfonal allurements. 1 fuppofe, therefore, that there can be no hopes at preSent, or very Saint ones, for

I HAVE just received another letter from Lord Ashbourne ; it is the most fatisfactory one I have yet feen of his writing. He , has opened his whole heart to Lady Bell : she gives him up, and now he is only apprehensive that I should think him incapable of constancy, from having changed merely in conSequence of .meeting with, a woman whom he liked better. However, tho’ many objections might be fairly made to Such a variegated conduct, I am, I confeSs,. too much prejudiced in his favour, to imagine ' that I shall ever'have reaSon to repent of my parti9lity''ifor him.

For my part, I own it has great weight with me ; but be that as it will,' it is a sine thing to have fo excellent an apology for the indulgence of my inclination. You . ould, I am afraid, rank me among the. vainest of women, and charge me with being intoxicated with the adulation of my lover, were I to relate the most trifling passages in Lord Ashbourne’s letter concerning myfelf: yet i may tell you—I ought, indeed, to tell you, of the extreme good nature of Lady Bell Wallace. She has behaved, my Lord fays, not only with the greatest propriety, but in the most friendly manner to him; and she has fpoken things in my praife, which she could have learnt from no body except Lady Lucy;

She wishes me happy with my Lord, and does me the honour to desire my acc^uaintance and friendship — My Lord fpeaks of her in the highest terms, in the most refpectful terms, and tells me, that no woman ever heard fuch a declaration as he was obliged to make against herfelf—and strongly against his will—with fo much patience and good humour. She is; I dare fay, a great deal handfomer and better than me; but while my Lord looks on me with partial eyes, I cannot be unhappy.

The dear little fellow promiSes to re-Semble my amiable Frankland, who is full as fond of him as 1 am; and who treated me, while I was in a situation which required his'tenderest attentions— But I should consider that you are not yet married, my dear Bell, and cannot, therefore, relish thpSe affectionate effusions which involuntarily flow from my pen. — I will restrain them, and make fame reply to your last letters.
I am pleafed to hear that you are free from an engagement which would not have been productive of real felicity to you ; and I think I know enough of love, to be certain, that without it, without mutual love, there can be no

I am pleafed too, methinks, So sind that Lord Ashbourne has behaved with fo much franknefs, and that you, my dear, , have listened to reaSon against yourSelf. with Such temper: for, however grating the declaration uttered by his Lordship might have been to your ear, it has, certainly, releafed you from an insinite deal of anxiety. Where is the woman who can be happy, without possessing the heart of the man whom she marries ?
You ash me what the world fays of you ; and you desire me to inform you of the opinions of your friends and acquaintance here concerning your conduct, if I am not quite rusticated.—I am indeed rusticated to fuch a degree, that 1 am looked upon as a perfon totally

dead to the world—that is, to the polite part of it—abfolutely lost in obfcurity ; you must not, therefore, expect the wished-for intelligence from me.—To convince you now of the truth of this affertion — Mr. Frankland and I have not been taken notice of by a single creature among our friends and acquaintance, Mr. Deshorough, Mifs Plastow, and Mr. Fanshaw excepted.—You will, probably, fee Mr. Fanshaw at Paris, if he is not yet arrived. He came here with a compliment from my aunt Selby, and desired to stand godfather to my boy ; to whom, as well as to Mr. Frankland and mySelf, he behaved in the gen-teelest manner, in the most friendly manner imaginable. As to the herd of great and gay,' with whom I ufed to be fo familiar, not one of them will condefcend to look upon the farmer’s wife,

I know mylelf fo much happier than I should have been in the most exalted fphere of life, without Mr. Frankland, that while he continues to be pleafed with me, I shall never repine: nay, should he change,, I shall derive fome confolation from the recollection of my having been once the happiest of women; of my having enjoyed a felicity which I never could have expected with any other man. There was fomething in his looks and manners which struck me when I sirst beheld him; and the similitude which I afterwards difcovered in our tafies and tempers, attached me very cloSely to him.—I have never had occasion to alter my Sentiments about him : I am perfectly Satissied with

To give you a fpecimen of the way of the world, I will communicate a little anecdote concerning Charlotte Wills.— You remember Mifs Wills : her father, though a very considerable merchant, met with difappointments which rendered him unable to leave her any fortune. She was left, indeed, entirely to the care of Lady Bridgen, her father’s sister, that she might be provided for, and rife, by her accomplishments, from nothing, as her aunt had done before her. MiSs ^ Wills was always, you know, reckoned very pretty : and she at last managed

I thought, would do the child good and I went with him myfelf, that I might be fure he would not. be kept out too long.

Lady Bell to Lady Lucy.
TH A N K Y E E, my dear friend, thankyee, for the pretty fellow you have fent me. I can no longer defer paying my acknowledgments. Why, this Fanshavr is handfomer, and has more wit, fenfe, and every thing, than Lord Ashbourne.—He will be a warmer lover too—if he is a lover at ail—I mean of me; for, at prefent, your Ladyship is the woman who engroffes his thoughts. No man, indeed, can fpeak in higher terms of a woman than he does of you: but I can bear his raptures, on your account, better than I did Lord AJhhournd.s on Mifs Plastow’s ; as you are married, my dear, you can do me no mifchief: 2	you

you will not take my man from me: when I have got him—yet whether I ever Jhall get him or not, is a question not easily to be anfwered. I think, however, that there is a great tendency in him towards me as your friend : he even ventures to fancy that there is a similitude in our features. I confefs I never heard of a refemblance between them before: but men fee strange things. It is vastly lucky though for me, as he is fo violent an admirer of you, that there happens to be a likenefs between me and your Ladyship. It is impoffible for him to think, me very difagreeable—Yet, as I, have been already fo duped by one man,
I ought to be extremely flow in giving credit to another. — Appearances are very deceitful: but he comes quite a-propos to be my dangler : I wanted an attendant in publick; I wanted alfo a K 6	man

man to countenance me just now, being in a deferted state. Mr. Fanshaw is the thing; he is handSome, youhg, lively^ and poffesied of an affluent fortune; with that fortune he has a foul to fpend it with elegance and taste. He is a charming fellow to be at one’s elbow in fuch a place as Paris. Once more, therefore,
I thank you for fending him hither, and for all the civil things you faid of me to him : they may have a proper weight in due time.
I am forry that you are sh much neglected by all your old acquaintance; but if they refemble Lady C——-, you are much better, I think, without them, than with them. What an infolent creature ! I have always obferved that your half-bred people can hCver bear any exaltation : it makes them* abfolutely giddy;

dy ; they neither know themSelves, nor any body elSe. You treated her, in my opinion, with a very proper contempt: but there is a delicacy in your concealing this inSult from Mr. Frankland, which would be imitated by few of your fex upon fuch an occasion. I have often wondered to fee women, who are really not in the leaf! concerned in the marriages of their female acquaintance,^ look upon them in fo defpicable a light, if they choofe men -with fmaller fortunes than they have reafon to expect. One would, imagine that an opposite mode of behaviour might be adopted in fuch situations—As envy is the predominant paffion in the generality, at least, of both fex-es, thofe who fee their friends degraded should be quite pleafed, and not thrown into an ill humour. Tour uncommon happinefs in the marriage state certainly

I dare fay I am fpared as little as you ; but we may both, Lucy, in time, perhaps, have an opportunity to laugh at them in our turn.
In Continuation,
Fanshaw has just brought me the fweetest Set of boxes for my toilette, of JS/uns work, you can imagine. Upon my word, he has a sine taste in every

Lord Ashbourne has been gene for England thefe three days : he took a very polite leave of me; and again begged my pardon for every thing that he might have faid to offend me. I wished him as happy with his Plastow, as I da you and myfelf with the men we like best.

As he was her father’s brother’s fon, and as he made no will, my wife comes into the posiession of a very ample fortune by inheritance. She inherits, indeed, every thing belonging to him. This considerable —and unexpected— acquisition, however, feems only to give her joy by “	^	enabling

For my own part, I am chiefly pleafed with it as it will throw her into the fphere of life in which she was born—in which she is thoroughly qualified, in every refpect, to shine. I am fufficiently rich in the poffeffion of her; richer with her than if I was poffeffed of all the^ treafures of the east. I wish not for myfelf more than 1 enjoy: but I have long earnestly wished that my Lucy was in a situation to live in a manner fuitable to the rank to which she was born. 7 he more ready she is to give up the indulgencies to which she has a right, the more indulgencies does she deferve. She de-ferves every thing the heart of man can invent to make her bleffed, I rejoice,

therefore, that it will be now in her power to gratify every wish of her heart—She will, I doubt not, shine with as much lustre in profperity, as she has shone in adversity :—to shine in the former state is to be very uncommonly distinguished.

“ You were not mistaken,” replied Mrs. Bowen, “ Lady Lucy never “ mentioned any thing relating to Sir “ George to me; but I know he was “ very much your enemy, as Mifs Wa-“ ters informed me that he, the very

IS I T down to write to you in the greatest hurry, to tell you that Mr. Menell is dead.

He has, probably, left fome legacies, but I shall be forry to hear of any considerable ones, as I wish you and
Mr.

Fanshaw, who, by the way, gains upon me prodigioufly, and who, had I not made a kind of vow never to put faith in man again, would, very probably, fucceed the fickle Ashbourne— fpeaks in the highest terms of Mr. Frankland, and fays, that if any body can deferve you, he alone muji be the man. He never faw a man fo anxious about a wife (he tells me) fo eager to pleafe her, as he was to pleafe you, at a time when L %	every

Before I could anfwer this modest request, a letter was brought me from Lord Ashbourne.—Had not Mifs Plafiow and my dear Louifa been mentioned in every fecond line, I should have actually mif-taken it for a love-letter to myfelf; fo full was it of tender epithets, and foft, descriptions.

LETTER the LAST.
Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
I THANK you, my dear Bell, for your last kind and entertaining letter : I thank you for your care about me : it was was kind, but, luckily, it happened to be neediest. I received the earliest advice of Mr. Menell’s death from a friend, who lately joined him at Montpelier, and who adds, that though he thought himSelf better, he could not have recovered. I had, for fome time indeed before I married, looked upon him as lost, and therefore felt not fo much as I should otherwife have done.
I can truly fay, that I did not wish for his fortune. I have, for a long while, been fensible that happinefs is to be enjoyed
The Disinterested Marriage. 223
joyed to as great a degree without a fuper-ssuity, as with it: yet, as my dear Mr. Frankland deferves every thing, I am glad he is now put into the poffession of an ample fortune coming from me, efpecially as he is incapable of being dazzled by it, or prompted to quit a mode of life which he has found, by experience, fo conducive to the health of his body, and of his mind. He has, indeed, met with fuch fuccefs in his farming affairs, that he intends to purfue them, only in a more extensive manner. He will now have firms fufficient for the enlargement of his designs, for the benefit of his poor neighbours, as well as for his own immediate advantage. He purpofes to fow more wheat and barley, to increafe the stock of cattle, pigs and poultry, in order to have it in his power to fupply the poor, and even the middling people, L 4	with

i with the necessaries of life, at a reafon-able rate.By thefe. proceedings, by letting final] farst:^5 to industrious people; and by planting forest-trees, he will, of courfe, improve his estate considerably in a few years, and be really ufeful to fociety.—^How nobly is a large fortune 'employed, when it is employed in this way!
I received, a few days ago, a letter from Lord Graffmgton, in which he congratulated me on the birth of my fon, and entreated me to permit him to fettle that fortune upon him, which ought to have been mine.
Mr. Frankland, in reply, told his Lordship, that as his fon would, if he lived, inherit a very large paternal estate,
he
i

he must decline the acceptance of his offer.	-
Thus you fee, my dear, my Charles well knows how to acquit himfelf upon every important occasion. I confefs I am charmed with his reply to Lord Graffmgton,- as well as his anfwer to the numerous compliments and invitations received by us since our deviation. What a strange magnetic power is there in wealth!
We have'been exceedingly diverted with, the behaviour of our former acquaintance, whom Mr. Frankland has treated, as they defeived, very cavalierly. To the Swymmers, and a few others, we shall continue to be attached; but we are by no means desirous of L' 5 ■ ; • -	. 'silling

Mr. Frankland will take a houfe for me in town, that I may come to it when I pleafe ; but we have rrHitually agreed to live chiefly here; to enlarge our farms, if we want room, and beautify our rural fpot, out of gratitude', as we sirst, he Says, enjoyed upon it that felicity fo rarely met with in the fashionable world, by the pairs who are fashionably united. »^How can happinefs be expected from

The Way to Please Him (See our Appeal to the Public, annexed to theSELF-DfiCEiv’D; or, The History of Lord Byron) we have fufficient Reafon to believe, that Orders coming from the Country to him, and, perhaps, others his Colleagues, will not be complied with, and various malicious and falfe Pretences assigned for So doing; We hereby acquaint all Country Dealers and others, l"hat, by Sending a Stage Coachman, or other Perfon, to our Shops, they will be immediately Supplied at the London Prices with any of our Books, on paying ready Money for the fame.
