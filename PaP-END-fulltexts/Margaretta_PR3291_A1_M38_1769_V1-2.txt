The honourable Mrs. Archer to Mar-GARETTA Couiitefs of Rainsfoi'd.
pJOURLY, my child, I implore the great DiSpenSer of mercy to increase in your foul all noble firm-neSs, all heroic fortitude.
Try, my beloved, try to triumph over adversity; Such a conquest will refieft honour on your doating parent ; it will contribute to her repoSe; it will comfort, conSole, and may perhaps prolong the number of her days.
Heaven, which distributes favours in its own wife SeaSon, may yet have B 3	many
many blessings in store for my Mar-garetta. We dare not look on happi-neSs as our due; we dare not demand it; but, at a hurrshle distance, we are not forbid from watching its approach; and iSit never arrives, still, my love, we are not diSallowed the faScinating pleaSure of expedlation.
SuppoSe happineSs a friend, from whom, by immenSe distance, we have, been long divided ; hours, days, months, nay, whole years, ’^e -.are looking forward for the return oj^this friend; and, though we neverffee him, yet are we never divested dS hope.

Severe as our trials have appeared’, there are many more in the world to wshom Fate has not been leSs rigid. Even in this kingdom, and at this time, have we not two noble families, wlioSe-tears are still stowing for the re-B 4	cent

Maria’s education has not been enlarged, neither is her knowledge of the world extensive; but then she is a compleat mistreSs of more uSeful acquirements : she reads charmingly; she is eaSy in her disposition, artleSs in her manners; modest, Sedate, and affedlionate; So that I shall miSs my Fanny leSs, finding still about me a good girl, whoSe inclinations are gentle, tender, and complying.
The doclor is a worthy man; he has a large family, no perSonal estate, and not very great church preSerment.
Maria has frequently refuSed advantageous offers, and affures her father she is determined on a single state. Now, in this caSe, my dear counteSs, I think, whenever Fanny is inclined to make a worthy man happy, B 5	I can

LETTER XLIV.
♦
Lady Emma Chelsea to Sir Edward • Onslow.
^OMMAND freely. How Smooth,
'	how eaSy, the word Command
glides from your pen. Sir Edward, “ Intreat that the counteSs will com-“ mand me freely.” Yes, thefe were your very words ; yet, rebel as you are, have you not dared to difobey orders, given, too, with the most .pressing injundions ? Did you not promife my sister to favour her with the particulars of a certain tranfadion ? Have you ever mentioned one Syllable to allay the thirst of her curiosity ?
O man.
[	14 ]
O man, man, man! how very ready to promiSe! how much more ready to rctrafi!
When I opened your letter, Sir Ed> ward, I thought to have found an exadt description of your lovely lady Anne; I forget her ladyship’s other name; no matter, if all Such as are disgraced like her’s, w^ere. buried in oblivion.
Cruel disappointment! instead of the pidture I expcdled, you talked of pheaSants, nighti.ngales, and Canaiy birds. Believe me, I was quite outrageous ; but ordering them to my presence, at sight of the dear creatures, my reSentment vanished.
You tell me, they^ are gentle as our Sex; I wish they may not be quite So much on the wing as your’s, becaule
now
/
L 15 I
now I have the Sweet rogues, I think: I would not part with them for an immensity..
You have oliged me So highly, by procuring for me theSe pretty feathered companions, that I feel myfelS inclined to pardon half a Score of your omissions, neglects, and breaches of promise, provided you fulfil your last of a late date.
The counteSs often talks of your lady Anne : she is more curious, more impatient, and perhaps not So very forgiving, as her sister, whoSe inqui-fitiveneSs, if Site has betrayed any,, proceeds from the hope of Seeing her beloved counteSs entertained, which, must be the conSequence of Sir Edward’s obedience.
I
Perhaps
1
[ ]
Perhaps you wonder at my alteration of stile; having, as you well know, little reaSon for any chearful ideas; but to tell you a Secret, I have been nibbling at a bit of revenge, and find it an excellent cordial to my Ipirits. -
Nancy Saxby has, as I fuSpedled, aftnally and really deferred her infatuated fool. Was there a name more contemptible, it should be his.
You may SuppoSe I have kept this incident from the counteSs; and alSo intreat, that when you write next, no notice may be taken of what I am going to relate.
I happened to be Sitting all alone, busied in thought, mufing and melancholy, just as the clock pronounced twelve ; not that identical twelve,
which
[ u ]
which strikes dumb the tongue of ignorance, and stiffens Superstition into horror; but the noon of day, when hobgoblins hide their heads, and cowards walk the church-yards without trembling. Had it not been at this chearful hour, I might have taken forfupernatural the appearance, which, ' I confeSs, startled me.
You remember Sir Anthony Grizzle; it was he who entered the room unex-pedtedly; his figure ten times more ghostly than when he left England; his white meagre face; his very white eye-brows, white hair, and white hands, he had matched, with inimitable exadtneSs, to a Suit of deaths equally white; which purity of perSon and dreSs might, by moon-light, have
made
[ ]
made him rather the objedl of terror than admiration.'
Condemn me not of Severity, when I tell you this man is a compound of vanity, curiosity, Scandal, and affedla-tion; a Superlative coxcomb, an egregious fool, an eternal talker, impertinently free, and ridieuloussy assiduous. But I forget, Sir Edward, that you are as well acq^uainted wdtli him as mySelfi
Would you believe it, the hideous fpedire once took into his wife head, that I, forSooth, had a tender for him j and why, think you becauSe I drank -to him at table, or perhaps desired him to Send me the wing of a chicken.
Shall I give you my yesterday’s con^* verSation with this wretch
Lady
[	19 ]	.
Lady Emma, I kiSs your ladyship’^s hands.
How long have you been in England, Sir Anthony ?
Last night, madam, I finished my travels over a bottle of capillaire, at my hotel de Grizzle; and would not omit the first opportunity of paying my . profound reSpeds and compliments of condolance to your ladyship.
Compliments of condolance to me. Sir ?
Do me the honour, madam, to fuppoSe, that I am immenSely concerned at the misfortunes of a family, that
Pray, Sir Anthony, (interrupting him) be more explicit; your words astonish me; they need an explanation.^
PardoBjib
[ 20 J
Pardon, madam; ’pon honour,
madam, your brother"s ward--------MiSs
Saxby made no Secret of the alfair to me, or I should have been more cautious.
At the .name of that creature, my mind was affaukcd by a variety of acute fenSadons j I felt my breath almost takesi from me, my face in a glow; and, on trying the organs of Speech, found them So strangely agitated, that I could hardly pronounce the question of, How, when, where, did you fee MiSs Saxby ?
I thought, Sir Edward, to have given you our conversation verbatim j but, on reflection, I find the one part So larded with frothy observations and ridiculous grimace; the other So interrupted, hesitating and broken ;
that
[ 21 ]
that I perceive the account I would fend you cannot appear intelligible, except in the plain dreSs of narration ; in which simple guiSe I shall, for that reaSon, tranSmit it.
About a fortnight since, the very evening before Sir Anthony left Paris, he met the vile girl at a public ball
given by the duke de N---------. He
immediately accosted her, having Seen her in ray lord’s family ; and received inSormation, that she had been in Paris but a few hours : So, as near as I can calculate, she must have left England about the time of ray brother’s wicked distreSs, So pathetically deScribed by CuSack.
Sir Anthony Supposing she did not come to France alone, enquired particularly for the earl and lady Rainsford;
when
[ 22 ]\
when the audacious and abandoned girl, with well affeded concern, told him, that her guardian being unhappily disordered in his SenSes, the counteSs had ordered him to be confined at Buckman Chace; that her commands were executed, and it was Supposed he would there end his days. She added, that being obliged, on this account, to chuSe other'protectors, with them she came to France, sin hopes travelling and dissipation would remove the melancholy she could not avoid feeling for the miS-fortunes oS her late guardian, on wshoSe virtue she Spoke profuSely; hinting, that his lordship’s malady occasioned much Speculation; the counteSs being in the best Spirits ima-' ginable, wshilst all his other friends
were
I -23 J
Tvere inconSolable, except lady Emma, who continued to live with the coun-teSs on So amicable a footing, as Surprized every body.
Ah, Sir Edward, was ever wretch So entirely devoted to infamy as this i She expoSes our family ; she invents the blackest falsities, to iryure the eounteSs, who, with mercy next to Divine, would have prevented her undoing. She tries to injure me, who, though witneSs to her shame, would have died, rather than betray her, whilst she prelerved even the appearance of remorfe.
Oh that her insinuations were just! Gh that Rainsford really was the madman she describes him ! I protest to Heaven, I haid rather, much rather, his intelleds were affeded, .than to
know
[ 24 ]
know him the guilty, unreasonable, wretch, he is. I will Say no more on the hateful Subjedl.
I Suffered Sir Anthony to give his elocution full Scope. My curiosity was' alarmed ;' and, by a thouSand questions, I drew from him what. I have related. On any other occasion I could not have listened to the insignificant ; but on this, I could pardon the impertinence of fiis viSit.
What he communicated affords me a glorious revenge. Rainsford is made wretched by the partner of his crimes; she deSerts him; I rejoice in her infidelity.
The time must come, when conscience will perSorm her office ; when the passion he once felt for his deSerted countefe, will return. We shall hear
him
[ i 5 1
him intreat; we shall See him kneel to be forgiven.
Already I exult in his humiliation. Good God ! how much more lively will be my pleaSure, when, by Sond insinuations, he hopes to gain her heart, and finds it too strongly fortified by honour for him to enter! O, I should expire with Satisfadbion, to witneSs his punishment! I shall taste no joy still I fee him groaning under the anguissi of his disappointment.
I got rid of my visitor with'all imaginable expedition, being under momentary apprehension lest the counteSs should join U3; but first, affured him ' every thing he had heard from the vile girl was falSe; that she had Scan-daloussy eloped from Row-Park, the
VoL. II.	C	feat
t 26 ]
feat of Mrs. Archer, under whoSe protedtion she had been kindly placed by my Sister, to endeavour at amending her heart, and to conceal an egre^-gious w'eakneSs in her condudt.
Sir Anthony received this intelligence as a proof of my confidence, and voluntarily Swore the particulars he had related to me should never again eScape his lips.
I am not So blindly intoxicated as to rest my faith on the Secrecy of a talking coxcomb, I expedl this pretty tale, which he has -imported from France, will Soon Spread over the four corners of a kingdom where fame has So many indefatigable agents. If any flying found of this nature should reach your ear, pray Speed it
hither
I.	^7 ]
Slither i but, for God’s Sake, Sir Edward, remember a '-p thus on the outside of your letter, that I may not open it before my Sister. Adieu,
Sir; you may always command the sincere friendship of

LETTER XLV.
Sir Edward Onslow to Lady Emma Chelsea.
gARL Y, late, morning, noon, night, and at all hours, have I been striving to shew my obedience.
Let me die, vrithout benefit of clergy; may the Sweet Smile of lady Emma never light upon me more, if I have not been shut up in my cloSet, without company, without books, without steep, nay, almost without food, ever since I had the honour of a reprimand, ^nd renewal of orders, from your ladyship.
No driver of the quill, writing for his daily morSel, could be more eager,
more
*
«	[	29	]
more diligent, to finish his tash, than Onilow to perform his duty.
A Suspension was his greatest crime. Do not, madam, believe him guilty of nesiledl. The incloSed sheets will
O
Speak his desire to be ranked first anti most indefatigable on the list of lady Emma’s staves.
Whilst I turn hero, and relate my own adventures, why diSregard the true, ancient, and dignified stile, of my predecessors in romance ?
Onstow, the most honoured, the most ambitious of men, humbly lies at the feet of lady Rainsford, and her adoreable sister; an event unfortunate, yet not unfortunate in a life devoted to their Service.
About the year sixty one, having the misfortune to loSe a worthy father, C 3	and
\
[ '3° ]	*
and my health being enfeebled by fo violent a shock of Sorrow, I embraced the advice oSmy friends, and went to Bath, flattered into a belief that its stilutary Springs would remove my bodily disorders, whilst thoSe contradted on my mind might receive Some alleviation from company and dissipation ; but, for a long time, I Sound both ineffedtual.
Extreme melancholy gave me an entire diSrelish to the pleaSures by which I was Surrounded. I contradted a habit of reServe; I avoided almost all my acquaintance; I affedted Solitude, and was alone in the midst of thousands. To music I became inattentive, though a Science of which I was once passionately fond. I forgot
to
[30
to gaze on beauty, and was stupidly inSenSible to wit.
My health found no greater benefit from the waters, than my Spirits Srom the enjoyments of the place.
I^ord James Creadon, for whom I had a particular esteem, young, lively, and the very quintessence of good nature, was the only perSon whoSe presence I never avoided, becauSe he loved me well enough, very often to indulge my humour at the expence . of his own.
One day, as I was Sitting alone in my uSual mode of reverie, his lord-ship, in a violent hurry, burst into my chamber; and dragging me away, without any kind of ceremony, told me a blazing star had just made its appearance on the South Parade, and C 4	dazzled
[ 32 J
dazzled the eyes of a thouSand Spectators ; adding, he w^as Sure it would wonderfully Suit the philosophical bent of my temper to contemplate So extraordinary a phenomenon.
I did not resist; I Suffered him to _ hurry me on; I even confeSs, the description he gave me of lady Anne Donald filled me with strong emotions of curiosity.
Notwithstanding our haste to reach the walk, her ladyship had left it before we came thither. I was disappointed ; lord James mortified to exceSs': he could not conceal his chagrin; but Seeing a party of ladies coming towards us, with whom he w'as fiightly acquainted, his countenance cleared up; and though I wajs
averSe
[S3 ]
averfe to joining them, he compelled me to go forward.
I observed in the looks of this little party a forced gaiety; they talked . with eagerneSs; they whiSpered, and Sometimes laughed affedledly; in So much, that his lordship, who pretended to understand them perSeflly, Swore their topic was Scandal; promising me high entertainment, if I would indulge their humour, and, for a moment, enter into the Spirit of defamation.
Far-from coinciding easily with his Scherne, I declared my Self utterly re-Solved against it; nay, I attempted to leave the walk : however, he would not desist: he dragged me, compulsively, by the arm; and coming up to the ladies, accosted them with a gay
C 5	air, '
[ 34 ]
air, expressive of pleaSure, and full of polite freedom.
I was introduced as his lordship’s Lriend. Our reception was gracious, and we found no difficulty in being admitted of their party.
Before we had proceeded a dozen steps, lord James was alked, if he had Seen the Surprising creature, the Northern Venus, who, at one glance, had Set Bath in a flame, conSuming pro-miScuoufiy the hearts of dukes, earls, yiScounts, barons, and humble e* Squires ?
A certain Smile, which accompanied this question, gave my lord bis cue. He forgot to do justice to lady Anne, -in complaisance to her rival beauties; yet in Such a manner as, had not every -female in the whole group been hoodwinked
[ 35 ]
winked by vanity, she must have felt the pungency of his ironic expressions. I trembled for him, lest it should be Seen through ; but I might have Spared my confusion, for, it Seems, he knew them better, or he would not have carried it to the ex-ceSs he did.
Never was a conversation of this kind dragged to greater lengths; and I could not help remarking, that the plainest woman preSent took more pains than the rest to depreciate the envied beauty.
‘ I wonder to God, cried she, what brought them to Bath, unleSs to ex-poSe their poverty ?
Ah, then you know the family, I preSume, madam, replied my lord.
C 6	Know
[ 36 ]
Know them ! yes, yes, I know them; (looking contemptuousty) the old Scheming dowager comes here to mend her own ruined fortune at the loo-table; or elSe to make that of her pretty daughter, by drawing in Some silly fellow who has more money than discretion.
Poor creatures! Pity they should be disappointed, Said a Second.
Ah, indeed. Says a third, it would be a terrible affair for people of title to die in a priSon; but, for Heaven’s fake, what better fate can the poor things expedt, unleSs, my dear, as you observed, dame Fortune should throw a cast in their favour.
Well, for my part, returned the other, I have no charity for Such people ; they are the very folks who
deServe
[ 37 ]
deServe to Suffer : neither mother nor daughter has a Spark of prudence, otherwise one might pity them. Last winter they appeared in town, I am ashamed to Say with how much Splendour : abSurd and ridiculous! when all the world must know they have nothing but the old woman’s jointure to Subsist on; besides, to my certain knowledge, her ladyship lets great part of that poor pittance flip through her play-purSe.
Severely mortified at a conversation So degrading, I was walking off un-obServed, when his lordship drew me aside, and Swore, in a whiSper, I should not leave him; Stay, for Heaven’s Sake, Onflow, Said he, stay one turn more, and I will go with you; faith, I am both tired and ashamed; never
more
[ 3« ]
more will I lead you or mylelf into another Such Scrape.
Contented with this apology, I withstood not his intreaties. We continued our walk ; and the Same question that had been at first alked lord James, was now addressed to me, namely, if I had ever Seen lady Anne Donald? to which I anSwered negatively.
I rejoice that you have not, replied lord James briSkly; I^am passionately fond of description : by your leave, ladies, I will give my friend a Sketch of this original.
Pray do, pray do; and Pray Do was echoed from every fide, expetst* ing, no doubt, a thouSand pretty compliments at her ladyship’s expence. But I, who knew every turn of his
expressive

expressive countenance, Saw with pleasure that their expeftations would be disappointed.
Wrapping his arms about himSelf, as though recolledlion filled him with cxtacy, mixed with Such an air of drollery as is past description, he cried out. What a talk have I undertaken! let me perish. Onflow, if I know where to begin; to which of ten thouSand charms shall I give the precedency ? Then affedting still greater rapture, he continued,
O, she is more than painters can expresi, Or youthful poets fancy when they love.
I’ll tell thee, Ned; she has the youth of Hebe, the freshneSs of Aurora, the Graces innocence, Juno’s dignity, the winning SoftneSs of Venus, and I
know
I
[ 40 ]
know not what of Diana in her eyes; O Such eyes. Such killing eyes!
Fie, my lord, interrupted one of the ladies, who, iS I have any Skill in physiognomy, was not perfedlly pleaSed with his encomiums, you do lady Anne injustice; indeed, you do; this exaggeration of her charms will give your friend a Sensible mortification, when he Sees them with his own eyes, which, perhaps, may not be quite So much dazzled as your lordship’s.
I could perceive a general Smile of contempt, on my declaring the most implicit confidence in his lordship’s judgment of beauty.
But give me leave, ladies; give me leave. Onflow, continued he, with an cagerneSs that increaSed their consternation,
[ 41	]
nation, give me leave to finish my description.
Here he was again interrupted. Enough, enough, my lord; for Heaven’s Sake, have done; Such long descriptions would vapour any one but a lover.
Pardon me, ladies; I will impoSe
•	on your patience but for a moment
•	longer. Ned, turning to me, I can give thee no idea of lady Anne’s bewitching eyes. Smiling mouth. Small white teeth, and lips of blushing Scarlet.
Since you will finish, pray, good my lord, tell Sir Edward what pains her industrious ladyship is pleaSed to take, in order to shew off theSe charms advantageoussy.
I leave
[ 42 ■]
I leave that to you, madam, bowing profoundly.
I understand you mighty well, lord James; but know. Sir, I am above theSe little arts, and can therefore de^ SpiSe them in another. None shall ever upbraid me with fantastical affedt-ation. I hate eyes frightfully languishing: the whitest teeth in the 'World I would rejedt, if one must be eternally grinning to expofe them; and as for Smiles, they are odious, if one’s mouth must be perpetually open with a laugh; ridiculous to a degree ! I allow lady Anne to be a pretty piece of still life.
All the world, madam, allows lady Anne to be beautiful.
Call it beautiful, if you pleaSe; but I am astonished, lord James, that you
can
C 43	]
can admire Such a mere prodiRstion of nature.
As she Spoke thus, her countenance was enssamed by reSentment, which did not lessen, when his lordship protested, that, without exception, lady Anne was the most lovely woman he had ever beheld.
I absolutely thought she would haye bilrst into tears; never did I See nriortification So Severe. My friend ' enjoyed her chagrin; I obServed it with pleaSure. Soon after, we took our leave, more than ever prepossessed in favour of lady Anne, and dying with impatience to behold her.
Many hours had not elapSed, when lord James informed me he had gained intelligence she v/as the next evening to be of a private party at Sir Joshua
Slade’s,
1
j
[ 44 ]
Sladels, v/here he visited without restraint; and offering to take me with him, I readily accepted his invitation.
Again we were disappointed. Lady MacSeaton came withoiit her daughter. Every one enquired eagerly Sor lady Anne; we were told she was much indiSpoSed with a violent head-ach, a | diSprder which had occasioned her | coming to the Bath, and by which she was Severely afflidled.
At first I refused to play; but be- i , ing *preffed by the lady of the houSe, who wanted one to cornpleat her sixth table, I Sat down, and was by accident placed in the Same Set with lady MacSeaton.
I Soon perceived what had been Said on the Parade that miorning was not entirely without foundation, I mean,
regarding
I
I
[ 45 ]
regarding her ladylhip’s love play*
Never Saw I a passion more predominant; it Spoke in her eyes, her cager-neSs betrayed it, and it trembled on her fingers.
The side bets were deep; she was engaged in them all; and, for a rubber or two, came off with entire Suc-ceSs.
Venturing still further on the partiality or fortune, she found it leSs and IcSs profuSe,’ "till, by degrees, its favours were changed to mortifying marks of diSpleaSure.
What a metamorphofe did this change produce ! Her ladyship’s countenance, Srom Serene and com-plaiSant, grew red with diScompoSure, fulpicion and confusion.
It
[ 46 ]
It happened I had not the honour of being her partner the whole eve ■ ning ; and, when broke up, I found myfelf enriched a pretty considerable Sum at her ladyship's expence.
The next night I met her again at the rooms, but no lady Anne. She was playing at the gold table; and ^ insisted on my being of her party in terms So exceedingly preshng, that I Was obliged to engage, though no lover of play; in particular, a declared ' enemy to every kind of chance game.
I took my place next her ladyship; and in leSs than the Space of two hours, was afked, with visible emotion, to exchange a bill, all her ready cash having made its exit; when drawing out, and examining her pocket-book, | with a thousand tokens of astonishment

mcnt and concern, she declared, she had either dropt it from thence, or elSe left it at her lodgings.
I Saw and knew enough to under-. stand the hint. I had no great dish- , culty in prevailing on her ladyship to ' uSe rriy purSe ; Sor which, in return, I was honoured with an invitation to drink chocolate with her the next ’morning.
Lord James was standing at my elbow; he gave me a Speaking look; he Seemed to Say, he would give the whole world to be included. I tried to give him the Satisfadtion he wished; and pretending he was engaged to breakSast with me, I made that an ex-cuSe for not attending her ladyship, in hopes to gain hint the favour I had obtained for mySelf.
My
[	4*	]	j
My little artifice Succeeded; and I was requested to bring his lordship with me, for which he afterwards loaded me with acknowledgments.	i
Lady MacSeaton, the next morn-	|
ing, received us with a great deal of affability ; returned me the trifle she had borrowed the preceding evening; and having accommodated that affair, ordered breakfast; at the Same time dispatched a Summons to her daughter, who entered in a moment aSter.
Love, at first sight, like a fire newly kindled, must be immediately Smo* ^ thered, or it will blaze with uncon- ^ querable fury. I gazed on lady Anne; I my heart was strangely agitated; I j felt the consuming Spark, without try-	{
ing to extinguish, or even repel its	I
force,'	[

[ 49 ]
force, still So far Spread, that it bashed the force of opposition.
How much Sweeter is a paffion begun with refiecstion, advanced by rea-Son and esteem, than that Sudden, tumultuous SenSation, by which the Soul is borne away. Sometimes even against its judgment! This pre-posseffion I have woefully experienced; I wonder at my infatuation; I Scarcely then understood it; I cannot now explain it; it is only to be explained by the preSence of lady Anne; -her shape, her hands, her neck, her hair, her eyes, her teeth, her whole perSon together, can alone account for it:
Lady Anne was beautiful to exceSs, yet it was not that kind oSbeauty which, on mature deliberation, I have since ad-VoL. II.	D	mired:
[ 50 ]
mired: there is in her lovelineSs a kind of haughty fierceneSs, which oc-caSionally gives place to the most insinuating mildneSs, the most passionate tcnderneSs.
She is inclined to ambition ; she has an inexhaustleSs fund'of art; and whatever she desires, she desires with immoderate violence. Such was the perSon to whom, at first fight, I Surrendered my freedom. Lord James alSo yielded at discretion; and from , that moment we became distrustful of each other,	*
My opportunities of conversing with lady Anne were frequent; my passion hourly increafed: I knew she Sprung from a noble houSe, though ill treated by fortune; and I regarded Such an alliance not lefs honourable to
my
i
[ 51 ]
my family than pleasing to my Self, from the most passionate motives of inclination.
My resolutions were taken before lord James had fixed his. I applied to the ladies; my application was not rejedled : my addresses were approved by the dowager, and not ill received by her daughter, who Soon gave me Tcffon to SuppoSe I was regarded with more than indifference.
I thought mySeiSthe happiest fellow in the univerSe. I was no longer afraid of finding a favoured rival; and, as a proof of my Sincerity to lord James, I told him my situation. Supposing he had relinquished all thoughts of the lady, becauSe, for Several days, ' his visits to her grew stack; and to me he was leSs reServed than he had D 1	been
[ 5^ ]
been since that morning on which I introduced him to lady MacSeaton.
My Suppositions were groundleSs. His loidship affured me, he loved lady Anne; that he only waited still he could reconcile his own inclinations to matrimonv, and his father’s to that of his marrying an indigent woman of quality; and when he had acconi-pliSlted thoSe two points, he Swore to oppoSe my pretensions with all his power.
Our former friendship Seemed diS-Solved ; a warm altercation enSued : he treated me roughly ; I reSented his uSage: he drew: forced, in my own defence, to do the Same, I for-tunately difarmed him before a blow of any conSequence had passed on ei-,ther fide.
The
[	53	]
The event of this encounter v/as a warm renewal of our intimacy. Tho’ his lordship, at that time, would not voluntarily give up his hopes of poS-Seffmg lady Anne, a request I presumed not to make him, yet the next morning he generou Qy dropped all pretensions, and left me free to pursue what I then thought my happineSs.
Nothing could be more flattering than the progreSs I Seemed to make in the affections of m.y mistreSs ; and, to complete my felicity, I Saw lord James paying a thouSand assiduities to a young and amiable heireSs, who Soon after came to the Bath, and with whom he is since connedled.
From the most gloomy mortal breathing, I became the most volatile. My health was restored; my taste D 3	for
[ 54 ]
for pleaSure returned ; Scarce a day passed, in which I did not Surprize lady MacSeaton and her fair daughter with Some unexpeDed amuSement, for which the latter would often repay me with Smiles and protestations flattering to my love.
Her Smiles were treacherous, her I protestations deceitful; yet I was cheated by them.,
I perSuaded mySelf nature never moulded a form So perSeft; but,' to . make it a repository of-its best and ’	|
most valuable graces, I gave her a thouSand perfections; I thought her 1 the most finifned work of Heaven; her adlions have since cancelled that opinion; I no longer See her in that light; thoSe virtues I fancied glowing in her boSom were ideal, merely ideal;
how
I
I
j
[	55 ]
how lively do they bloom in the breast oS another ! another, to whom I have devoted a heart still warm with Sentiments of love, of gratitude, of admiration ! Further of its Situation I dare not reveal.
Nothing remained but to six the day of my eSpouSals with lady Anne, when I was called from her by the indiSpensible necessity of attending a dying uncle, impatient to give me his last embrace: I loved, I venerated this relation, and hastened to him.
My parting with a woman, on whom I then doated, is Scarce to be deScribed. When She bid me adieu, with what Seeming pain did the words iffue from her lips! When she tore herSelf from my arms, how fast the pearly drops of well counterfeited Sorrow fell from D 4	her
[ 56 ]
her reSplendent eyes I Her tongue, with silent music. Spoke of fidelity; it regretted my abSence; it prayed for my return; norfaultered in giving utterance to vows of eternal constancy.
Was ever man more cruelly de-'	ceived ! was ever woman better {killed
in deception 1 I have known the height of female perfidy ; I have Suffered from that knowledge: 1 once regretted the dear bought experience;
I no longer regret it: there is one whoSe Superior virtues have made me loSe sight of reSentment; that one reconciles me to a Sex of vrhich she is its greatest glory; that one is the most sincere, the most amiable, the most generous of women.
My uncle’s ilIncSs continuing Some weeks, and he not abte to Support the
thoughts
I
[ 57 ]
thoughts of my leaving him, I wrote to lady Anne, and not only received her permission tq continue my attend--ance, but Sne alSo generoufiy declared that my affedtion to So near a friend, and the dutiful reverence I expressed for him, increased the fervency of that esteem she had ever felt for me.
Thus, by frequent letters full of tender expreffions, did she continue to increaSe a passion, of which, ail that very time, she knew herSelf unworthy.
Contrary to expeclation, my uncle’s physicians began to entertain hopes of his recovery, and I prevailed on him to diSpenSe with my attendance, in order to throw mySelf at the feet of my beloved mistreSs, who, in a letter of a late date, had informed me she .D 5	was
[ 58 ]
was returned to London with her mother.
Thither I went, winged with impatience.
I waited not the ceremonial of advertising them by a card of my intentions, but flew, with ardour, to lady MacSeaton’s lodgings, in Harley-street,
I Saw her ladyship at the window, yet I was informed by a Servant, that his ladies were gone out.
Ah, thought I, how fortunate am I! how pleaSed will they be, that chance has better informed me, or I should have been turned away with the common herd of visitors!
I rushed by the fellow without Speaking;, I mounted the stairs; I Saw the door of an opposite apartment
open;
[ 59 ]
Open; my heart beat high, when I heard the delicate finger of my love touching the harpfichord, accompanied by her Syren voice. I hastened forward, filled with unutterable tran--Sport.
Lady MacSeaton was still standing at the window. There was a Screen that prevented my Seeing her daughter. I entered precipitately; but the room being covered with carpet, neither of them heard my footstep.
Passing the dowager, in my way to lady Anne, I kissed her hand ; she turned Suddenly tov^ards me, and exclaimed, Good God ! Sir Edward On-fiovv, is it you ?
I Scarce heard what she Said; I fiew
/
where my heart was deposited, prepared for the most tender reception.
D 6	I started
t ]
I started back Some paces, when I perceived before me Something like a man, but of a form So fantastical, as made me doubt, at a first glance, iS it was really human, or only a tinSelled representation of humanity.
I looked again ; it was a man, a man lolling over lady Anne’s Slioulder, with an air of the most perfedl familiarity.
Lady MacSeato-n followed me with expressions of Surprize; she looked utterly confounded ; her daughter aiSo betrayed equal astonishment, equal confusion.
My heart, as yet, was too full of love, to leave any room for SuSpicion. The pale guilt which overSpread her face, I attributed to the most flattering cauSe. I took her hand, pressed
it
-	[ 6i ]
it to my lips, intreated she would not be alarmed.
Pardon, my dearest creature. Said I, a Sreedom too abrupt; consider, my angel, I was hurried into it by a tender, irresistible impulSe.
Indeed, replied her ladyship coldly, withdrawing her hand, this is a favour 1 was not prepared to expedt. How long. Sir, have you been in tov/n ? Pray, Sir Edward, Sit;^ p^ay, my lord, be Seated,
The appellation of My lord was addressed to the Same diminutive thine; which, at first sight, 1 SuppoSed to be onlya,model of human nature.
I was excessively embarraffed; I knew not how to brook a reception So contrary to my hopes. Never was a more aukward Situation: I wished
incessantly
[ 6a ]
incessantly the titled intruder would withdraw; his preSence, I imagined, occasioned her restraint: I expedled, when that bar was removed, she would banish her unpleasing reServe; that she would confcSs Some joy at my return ; that I should be honoured with new proofs of her attachment.
Comforted by theSe and Such like Suppositions, I almost imperceptibly	i
regained my uSual compoSure, bearing part in a general conversation of Bath, and other indifferent matters.	I
After I had paffed half an hour, or upwards, in this manner, a Servant entered ; and bowing to my lord, his lordship immediately quitted the room.
His exit filled me with ineffable pleasure; I left iny chair, and v/ent '
towards.
f
[ 63	]
towards lady Anne. Her countenance changed as I approached her; she arofe; she put her hand to her forehead, and complained of Sudden disorder, begging leave to retire for a moment.
I would have attended her to the door, but taking hold of her mother’s arm, she inSisted on my not leaving the room.
By Heaven, Said I, Seizing both her hands, before I loSe you, madam, even tor a moment, you must tell your Onflow he is not unwelcome.
Time will convince you, replied she, her face covered with , blushes let me go, Sir. She diSengaged her hands, and vanished from me.
There appeared Something So exceedingly mysterious in her words,
her
[ 64 ]
her looks, in short, her whole manner^ that my boSom was racked with Suspicions, Soon, too Soon, realized by the strongest confirmation.
Perfidious lady Anne! you left me not for the cauSe you artfully pretended ; you left me to bestow your-
felf on lord N--------, Yes, ladies,
she had the cruelty, whilst I waited . ' her return, to celebrate, in the very next apartment, her nuptials, with that titled, insignificant bauble. I Saw her no more; a letter from lady MacSeaton was all the Satisfaction I received.
Her ladyship condelcended to apologize for the change in her daughter’s-affairs ; she Said lady Anne had been addressed. Soon after I left Bath, by lord N—<—, who was now her huS-
band;

band; but family reaSons obliged her to cloSe with his propoSals; and hoped, as matters had proceeded no further between us, I might be Soon happy with a lady more at liberty to follow her inclinations.
In the bitterneSs of my reSentment, and in the first diSorder of my passion, theSe, and a thouSand other fiattering insinuations, I stamped beneath rny feet; and, ashamed to have indulged a fervent, honourable love, for an objed fo unworthy, I reSolved to leave England; I did leav^e it, and found an effedual cure in abfence.
Thus, my fair and most amiable friends, have I executed your commands, obeying them without reServe.

Cusack to Lady Emma Chelsea, in-cloSed in the preceding.
^JpHE confidence your ladyship and Mrs. Archer are pleaSed to re-poSe in me, I try to bear with equanimity; yet, when I refledt how greatly they exalt their Servant, I feel SenSa-tions too lively for threescore years and ten. To be called their friend ; to be confided in; to be trusted with their dearest concerns, is a weight of honour I hardly know how to Support. The Same lightning which fills with glorious illuminations the timeworn cottage, the Same, I now experience.
[ 75 ]
rience, may shake its feeble, tottering foundation.
How shall I repay Such infinity of goodneSs, Such unhoped for condescension! More faithftil I cannot be; my fidelity I cannot, but my watch-fulneSs I will, endeavour to increaSe.
I bleSs God, my excellent young lady, your brother is not So very guilty as you believe him ; faulty he may have been ; I fear he has been faulty; would I could pronounce his heart as free from stain as I can now declare his acstions ! God alone can do this.
I shuddered when I found his lord-ship SuSpeded of a criminal intrigue with his ward, MiSs Saxby : I thought over in my agitated mind the proofs by which he v/as accuSed; I considered E 2	his
C 76 ]
his frequent abSence; this alarmed them ; I was half perfuaded she must be Somewhere concealed near my lord; I refietsted on your ladyship’s hint of this nature; I Saw in a moment you had given me a right clue, by which I might diScover her retreat!
Accordingly, day after day, I fol- “ lowed him, unobserved, in all his walks 5 but never did I Sec him, to my great astonishment, enter houSc or hamlet; on the contrary, my lady, he Seldom went farther than the fir grove, or the forest beneath; and it is probable, when I have often thought him at a considerable distance, he has not wandered from one or other of theSe Spots,	|
Observation
[ 77 ]
Observation has taught me how he passes his moments in theSe excursions.
After traverfing the Same Spot still weary of exerciSe, he Seeks out the most gloomy receSs; he stretches himSelf on the graSs; he hangs over the river; or he fits at the foot of that venerable oak, where, in happier days, I have Seen him Solace himSelf with your ladyship and the counteSs. Sometimes he is buried in contemplations, I fear, of no pleafing nature; they often produce a sigh, a tear, a groan, and are always ushered in by clouds of melancholy.	He starts
from his reverie ; he riSes and pursues his walk; again, he throws himSelf on the earth, and returns to meditation.
E 3 ' I did
[ 7« J
I did not give over rny private attendance, notwithstanding I heard from your ladyship that MiSs Saxby had been Seen at Paris; but Still, un-noticed, followed his footsteps.
This morning, as I stood concealed near his lordship, I obServed him take a paper from his boSom, which he contemplated with a countenance more inflamed than I can well de-i Scribe. After gazing on it a moment, he returned it to his breast with this vehement exclamation,
CurSed, curSed lines I hellish insinuation !
Again he was silent.
I remained attentive'to his adlions, and Soon after heard him call out on , MiSs Saxby, in an agony of expression which convinced me your ladyship’s
Sulpiciona
[ 79 ]
fufpiclons were not without foundation.
I hesitated a moment; I Sav/ the torture of his Soul, and reSolved to probe the wound by which it was" affected.
Was not the design, my lady, strangely preSumptuous ? Recollection amazes me; I wonder at my own hardineSs..
The counteSs does not See this; file Sees none of thoSe* letters which I am commanded to addreSs in private to your ladyship; for this reaSon I m.ay preSume to write freely.
Pardon, my lord, Said I, preSenting mySelf before him, pardon an intrusion occasioned by motives of duty to your lordship’s perSon, and concern for the repoSe of a family, whoSe E. 4	p^ace,
[ *0 ]
peace, I fear, is threatened with a fatal interruption.
His lordship started when he first Saw me; Sorrow was more visible than anger on his countenance.
What would you have, CuSack ? Why do you follow me
Let not my lord, whoSe virtues, from the first dawn of reafon, have been witnessed by his Servant; let him not Suppofe me the wretch to blast them in imagination.
Speak on.
I Seek not, my honoured lord, to know whence proceeds that revolution by which my Soul is afflidled. Whatever be the cauSe, I aSk it not; but the world has an evil eye eternally open: even innocence is contaminated by its malignant glance; and you,
my
[ J
my most loved, my rr.ost venerated patron, have not eScaped its cenSure. Mifs Saxby-------
What of her.? (in a voice broken and hesitating) I charge thee, on thy life, conceal nothing from me which may concern the fate of that good girl.
Ah, Sir, forgive the freedom of your old Servant: if MiSs Saxby is a good woman, the world is deceived. It is rumoured, it is believed, that her arts have Seduced the Soul of my lord, disturbed his domestic happineSs, and drove him to Solitude.
Hold, hold, replied his lordship'; prophane not the charader of a per-Son who has no fault, except a too strid observance of honourable principles can be called one: had she aded with kSs delicacy, I will con-E 5	fcSs
[ 82 ]
feSs to thee, my good old man, I might have been more happy.
Encouraged by this kind, this condescending mark of confidence, I threw mySelf at his feet, and beSought him to tell me, if MiSs Saxby had not been, for Some time, concealed in the neighbourhood of Buckman Chace ?
T I know what your Sulpicions are. Said his lordship, commanding me to riSe: I have never Seen her here; yet, perhaps, I have Seen her too often for my peace : no, by all that’s holy, the virtuous creature has nor, with my knowledge, been near this place,, neither is she under my protedtion. Alas, poor girl, she loved her guardian ; she knew his unhappineSs, and flew from the kingdom to avoid be-hokling it..

Your ladyship cannot pidlure to yourSelf what I felt as my lord Spoke thus: I Saw, in a moment, the true situation of his heart y I Saw that a falSe, guilty passion, had poffeffed it, which, in time, must prove its de-strudfion. Could I See ail this with calmneSs ? No, my lady, I was poS-Seffed by the most violent ^ Sorrow; and, in the bitterneSs of my grief,, forgetting the preSence of my lord, I curSed the artful woman who had disturbed his happineSs.

Heaven forbid, my lord, that the marks of anger your lordship’s silence threatens, should So Sar intimidate your Servant, as to make him, by a shameful apology, confeSs, that in his Soul he lied, when he Spoke wrathfully of the enemy both of your honour and your repofe. I do not repent of the expression I have uSed; it was extorted by my duty : neither am I affiidted by your diSpleaSure, becaufe I know you will withdraw that diSpleaSure on refiedtion. But ah, my lord; Say not you pardon me, unleSs, at the Same time, you alSo Say you never wish to behold again the woman who has cauSed you to entertain thoughts unworthy of yourSelf. Whilst her idea is preServed in your lordship’s boSom, death would be more desire-
able:

able : yes, my lord, in Such a cafe, death itSelf would be more desireable than your favour : it would kill me, by degrees, to watch the diminution of your glory; your diSpleaSure would end my miSeries a shorter way.
Had I Spoke this from motives lest cffential than thofe from which my words proceeded, no punishment would have equalled my preSumption. Your brother, madam, knows my , heart; he had the goodneSs to hear me without interruption ; he condescended to lay his hand on mine; and Said, with a Smile which had nothing of joy in its nature, but fully expressive of melancholy. Thy zeal, CuSack, was Somewhat too ardent; it hurried thee to lengths for which I was not prepared; you have curSed
the

the woman on whom my foul once doated : yet, TromiSe you will nevermore talk to me on a Subjedl by which^ 1 am infinitely distressed; and I will not only pardon thy imprecation; but further, to- Satisfy thy honest doubts, I Swear Solemnly to avoid,, from this hour, the sight of her who^ has destroyed my felicity.
When I Saw the tears of remorSe-streaming down his lordship’s cheeks,, (for indeed he could not fuppreSs them) I felt my old bofom warm with rapture; I gave a vent to the emotions of my pleafure; I cried: out. Merciful God, thou fufferest not thy fervants to err beyond convidlion ; now will my honoured lord return to his virtuous counteSs ; now shall she fold, him in her faithful arms, and:

Soon preSent him the mutual pledge' of their affedlion. Heaven, my lord, continued I, willrestore in you a father to the little innocent, who would, wsithout this bleffing, have Seen the* light in wretchedness.
I cannot tell your ladyship what were now his SenSations; but this I can Say, that I am well convinced he-still adores his counteSs. Could I See them restored to each other, I would not aSk another moment of Heaven:: of their own accord, my eye-strings would crack; they would crack with pleaSure, could I once more straim them to behold my lord in the embraces of his counteSs.

Alas! alas! Sliall the pattern of all perSedion be thus buffetted by Sorrow?
A weight of years draws me toward my parent earth. An old man, bending to his grave, cannot be a distressing fight. He has bloomed his SeaSon here; he has not been untimely cropt; and hopes to renew his Spring in eternity. But to fee So lovely. So fair, So Sweet a bloffom, in the noon of life,

drooping on its stalk, negleded, trodden under foot, by the perSon God had purpoSely designed to prop, to Support, to Sustain it; ah me, what a sight is this! it rends my heart! I weep bitterly to behold it!
My lady, I have much to tell you; v/here shall I begin ? The counteSs is exceedingly ill; your ladyship’s preSence, I fear, is necessary.
O,	madam, what shall I Say of your brother? Would to God I had been laid low, rather than witneSs what I have witnessed.
Was your ladyship conSulted before the counteSs came hither r The question is impertinent; she would not, ia that caSe, have come alone. I know the passionate tenderneSs of lady
ma*s
[ 93 1
ma’s Soul; lady Emma would have come with her.
Never Saw I Such a Scene; never, never, may I See Such another.
I Said I had much to tell your ladyship ; I will try to recoiled it: Try! I need not try; it will ever be preSent to my memory.
Yesterday, or rather yesternight, it being after my lord had Supped, he commanded me to fetch from his library the history of Belifarius; and bidding me sit by him, condeScended to entertain me with feveral passages from that elegant author, whoSe beauties were greatly embellished by his own remarks: all of them are not now necessary sto my purpoSe; one alone I shall repeat.
Having

Having read, with visible signs of tender emotion, the character of the brave general’s beautiful and amiable daughter, he uttered a deep Sigh; and lifting his eyes from the book, What a happy prince, cried he, was the hushand of Such a woman! he raiSed her to dignity, and she added lustre to his crown. Your lady, Cu-Sack, was beautiful, modest, wife, and virtuous, as this amiable Roman; yet I have not been blessed like the youth who happily possessed her, be-cauSe, doubtleSs, Heaven Sees I am ieSs worthy of its blessings.
My eyes were fixed on the floor:
I was contemplating on his words :
I was considering in what guiSe I should discover the freedom of my thoughts, when I heard my lord give
a loud
t 95 ]
.a loud cry ; and looking up, beheld him in the arm,s of his counteSs, always lovely, now more beautifully majestic, Srom the awful mour ning of her habit. She had cast herSeif on his neck ; but O! my good God ! shall I, can I, tell your ladyship, how unkindly he broke from her embrace 1 how cruelly, how very cruelly, he stew from her to his own apartment!
Recolledlion stiffens me with horror!
In vain were my poor endeavours uSed to conSole her: to Inch a wife, to Such a woman. So treated, what conSolation could be offered ?
WitneSs, Heaven, how dear, how inexpressibly dear, the earl has ever been to my heart! WitneSs alSo, what I have felt, what I still feel, for his deServing counteSs!

Lady Emma and MiSs Archer arrived yesterday; since which time the earl has not left hia chamber; but, by repeated ineffedtual messages, has tried to bring the latter of thoSe ladies to him. About an hour since, anSwering the Summons of* his lordW ship’s bell, he Said, when I aSked his commands. Go, CuSack; once more go to MiSs Archer; intreat I may have the Satisfadhon of embracing her, of ashing after my venerable mother.
Her mother ! the mother of---------O	‘

TheSe mysterious words, and the manner in which they were pronounced, first awakened my Sufpicion; sior, still his lordship Spoke ssightingly of lady Emma, I never doubted the Sanity of his intelkds: but, could a ressedion So opposite to the charader „oS that amiable lady, iffue from any other cauSe ?
Alas, my poor lord, how fatally are you punished for your criminal infatuation ! it is that. Sir Edward, I 'am Sure it is that very infatuation which has dethroned his reaSon.
I have yet had no opportunity of delivering the message with which I was charged to MiSs Archer; and,
in

in the light I now consider my lord, I shall most certainly SuppreSs it.
What do I hear! I tremble whilst I write. Alas, the counteSs! _ She this moment gives a Son to her noble, diSconSolate family, yet is inSensible of the gift.' It would fill us all with gladncSs, could it be received without the ioSs of her precious, inestimable iiSe; of that, I fear, there are no hopes.

Continuation.
J^ADY Emmia is the exadl original of what we once thought a fiat^ tering copy. My brother barely did her justice. She owes nothing to description ; ail description must fall short of her perfedlions.
"dn our first interview, she honoured me with the most tender appellations. Whilst she held me in her arms, I thought. Would to God it may be So, that I was not embraced by lady Emma ChelSea, but by lady Emma Onflow. She has all that amiable openneSs, that charming innocent tin-reServe, which you So fervently admire, F 5	, I am
[ io6 ]
I am already v/ell acquainted with her heart: she Scruples not to call my brother their best, their kind, their valuable friend: she caresses me as the sister of that friend. In short,-— but J will Say no more. Sir Edward, lest I should be too Sanguine.
MiSs Archer is a Sweet, engaging girl; she and lady Emma both declare themSelves penetrated with vrhat they are pleaSed to call my goodneSs in coming to them.
The counteSs still continues inSen-Sible to every thing. The earl I have not yet Seen : O, how I detest his infidelity ! how I hate his. ingratit;ude !
One would think the wretch’s heart w^as converted into stone. Would YOU believe it, he has never once ashed to See lord Gore!
Ah,
[ i°7 ]
Ah, my kind, my beloved hushand, it was not thus you received our little Charley. How much leSs deServing, yet how infinitely happier, am I than lady Rainsford!
My heart bleeds from every vein. Alas, Mrs. Archer, you are by this time acquainted v/ith the Situation of your deServing daughter ! Sensible, pious, and resigned, as they Say you are, will your understanding, will your piety, will your rcfigiiation, Support you now ?
It was impossible to keep the coun-teSs’s danger any longer from her mother. What may be the conSequence of revealing it, I tremble but to think.
Neither lady Emma or MiSs Archer have taken off their cloaths for three nights Successively; fatigue of mind F 6	and
0
[ ]
£nd body has almost harraffed them to death. For this one night 1 have got leave to watch by the counteSs, and, with difficulty, prevailed on them to repoSe in another apartment. I am now fitting by the bed of lady Rainsford, and am often forced to lay down my pen. Flinty is that breast which can feel only for itSeif; inSensible the eyes which, without overflowing, can gaze on the Spectacle before me.
Flark ! Some one taps Softly at the door! What ails me.? Why am I fluttered ? What kind of fear is this which invades me ? The fame signal again 1 Thieves would not knock thus. I'he nurSe is steeping. The clock strikes one. Again! Well,
ni
[	*°9 3
ril go and See who it is that comes ■at an hour So unSeaSonable.
'	Continuation.
I thought I should have Sunk, when opening the door, with a candle in my hand, I Saw a man upon his . knees, on the outside:; who catching hold of my gown-, begged, for Heaven’s Sake, I would not cry out, and alarm the family.
Is it possible, my dear, you can imagine what I felt! Surely you can have no conception of my cowardice.
I trembled from head to foot: I was incapable of Speaking, and Suffered the perSon who addressed me to proceed without interruption.
Fear.nothing, madam; though we are strangers to each other, let me
intreat
•V
[ ]
intreat you will diSmiSs your apprehensions. I am BO robber; I come not to invade the property of another. I know not, madam, how you came to this houSe ; but, now you are here, confirm, I beSeech you, thoSe characters of compassion which I can trace upon your countenance. Alsist a man unhappy through his own imprudence.
Whilst he Said this, 1 looked at him with attention; and Soon discovered, from the Sorrow visible on his face, the disorder of his dreSs, and elegance of his perSon, that this could be no other than the earl himSelf; in whicli opinion I was Soon confirmed, by his addressing me in theSe words:
Yes, madam, whoever you are, it is you must assist the unfortunate Rainsford; if you know the power
of
[ ]
of humanity, you will not refuSe to assist him : he has not a friend in this family: thoSe he Seeks fly from him, and thoSe who Seek him he avoids. Lady Emma and MiSs Archer went to repoSe themSelves in a chamber joining mine.: I heard them retire; and thinking to find no other perSon with the cou.nteSs but her women, I would not resist a last struggle of ten-derneSs to behold my wife, to take one fond, one farewell embrace. I must repeat. Whoever you are, madam, lead me to her: she will be in-SenSible of my caresses: I may, without restraint, this once, indulge them.
^	Whilst he Spoke, I forgot my re-
fentment, and was penetrated with compassion: tears Sprung from ray eyes: I took his hand in silence: I
led
[ 112 ]
led him to the bed, and retired to a distant part of the chamber.
Having waited a considerable time before I thought of interrupting him, my ears were assailed by a dreadful groan, from which Seemed to iffue the name of Sir Edward Onflow, pronounced by my lord, as if he called upon him for his assistance.
I stepped hastily to the bed, where I found the earl stretched, SenSeleSs, by the fide of his counteSs.
Whether, at that moment, she had any faint recollcdlion, 1 know not; but her lovely eyes, which had been fixed, for many hours, on one objeD, were now turned, with dying Sweet-neSs, towards her hushand: however, if this was an effort of memory, it was a weak one only, for they were
Soon
[	!'3	]
Soon again dsteded to their former station.
Having rouled the nurSe, by her affistance I raiSed his lordship from the bed; and we applied Such medicines, without calling up the family, as foon restored him tohimSelf. Again he called on Sir Edward; and casting another look on the lovely, inSen-Sible counteSs, he threw himSelf on his knees by ,sher side, and, with a torrent of tears, bedewed her Snowy hands, that lay extended on the quilt.
I could not help, guilty as I considered him, joining my tears with his; I could not help weeping for him : I took his hand, and begged I might condud him to one whoSe preSencc would Soften his afflidtioa.
He
[ II4 ]
He made no resistance; and I led him to the cradle 'of lord Gore, in which the Sweet innocent was steeping.
I was pleaSed to See with what tender emotion his lordship regarded the child. With the candle in his hand, he stooped towards the cradle; he examined every feature minutely, but would not Suffer me to take the infant up, for fear of disturbing it.
After he had been thus employed many minutes, he Said, as if Speaking to the child. You will not want my protection ; Onflow will protect you; for the fake of your parent, he will protedl you.
I was glad.to hear him mention my brother with Such affedtion. I ^ flatter mySelf his preSence will give a
turn
[ S
turn to the affairs of this afflided family.
If the earl is really So very penitent for the wrongs he has done his coun-teSs : If, did I Say ? Surely there is no room even to doubt. Well, then, Sir Edward’s Scheme for totally eradicating a guilty passion cannot fail of fucceSs. There is a possibility the counteSs may yet recover; if she does, there is more than a possibility that we may fee them happy in each other.
I believe the earl does not yet know who lam; he alked my name, and I told him I was the wife of colonel Onssow. I fancy he heard not what I Said, as he vanished from me with precipitation; hearing, as I shp-poSe, the footstep of lady Emma, who
was
i [	116 J
was then coming tov/ards her sister's chamber.
J Said nothing to lady Emma of what had paffed; and prevailed On her, after Sne had looked in upon the counteSs, kissing her tenderly, to return again to her bed, as it was then hardly three b’clock.	»	'
Since her ladyship left me, I have been buSy at my pen; and shall Send this letter expreSs by John, who had last night my orders to hold himSelf in readinefs.

There is Something noble, though obstinate, in his condudt; his repentance has in it a degree of steadineSs and refinement: I could pity him ;

When I Saw the litter stop which conveyed Mrs. Archer, forgetting I was quite unknown to the unhappy lady, I fiew, amongst the rest, to assist her from the carriage; but, with all my expedition, I came too late. At the door I met her leaning , on lady Emma and MiSs Archer, like weeping angels Supporting the pale eshgy of woe.
All was hush; every one’s Sorrow Silently expressive.
The afflided parent had not yet Spoke, had not yet raiSed her pensive eyes from the ground ; when she did, it was only to lift them up to Heaven.

She took the hint; and stopping Suddenly, intreated her she would repoSe herSelf a few minutes in that apartment, still lady Rainsford vras apprised of her being So near; at the fame time affuring her the counteSs .was really better, and the malady on her mind much abated.

[ 126 ]
whole words had not yet found a passage, but whoSe tears were unremitting.
Lady Emma was gone to the counteSs; and I, not unmoved, stood gazing on the Scene before me; when Suddenly lord Rainsford burst into the room, threw himSelf at the feet of Mrs. Archer, and embracing her knees, cried out, in a voice of greater woe than I can well expreSs, Turn not from me, most revered of women! I am Sufficiently wretched; add not your diSpleaSure to increaSe my wretch-edncSs.
Cmel lord ! you that have covered me with misfortunes, replied Mrs. Archer, raising her head, and casting at him a look of penetrating grief; why invent a new Species of cruelty
to
[	>^7	]
to complete your crimes? Rife, my lord, your humiliation inSults me; forbear to Sport with my calamities.
Hold, madam, interrupted the earl; for the Sake of Heaven, accuSe me not again ; I love, I honour, I revere the mother of my counteSs. You 'tax me with cruelty ; to you I must appear cruel; to mySelf only I am cruel: Spare me then; to your daughter, to you, I have been just, too just; too just for my repoSe.
MiSs Archer, who, unable to look at the earl, had turned away, now stepped tovrards him; her Sweet eyes divested of their uSual mildneSs, and her lovely face infiamed with reSenc-ment.
Talk not of justice, cried she, most inhuman of thy Sex! Ah, my dear-G 4	ess;

As he Said this, lady Emma came out of the counteSs’s chamber, and Started back with astonishment when she Saw her brother preSent.
His lordship appeared equally con-fuSed; and dartino- at her a look of unutterable anger, ssevr from the apartment.
Why
[	129	3
Why does he sty his amiable Sister ? But, in short, is not his whole behaviour unaccountably mysterious ?
Unhappy, guilty man, Said the most pious of her Sex, as. he went from us,, may God pardon thee; may the pure Spirit of thy injured wife, when divested of Sorrows, when doathed with immortality, become thy advocate. I^ead me to my child, lady Emma; but oh! how shall I Support -the killing sight! Yes, to me it must be killing. I will bleSs my beloved, and we shall die together.
Here she remained silent a moment ; then attempting to riSe, shq waved her hand, and beckoned to the door of her daughter’s chamber.

I cannot tell you the meeting between youth Sinking on the bed of ficknefs, and age bending lower with misfortunes, than by the weight of years that drags it to the earth.

To the Same.
H E counteSs is amazingly composed and Serene, though her end visibly approaches.
I Say nothing of the family : what can I fay, except that many of them would gladly exchange their Situation . with lady Rainsford; rather than witneSs her dissolution, they would joyfully meet their own.
She is not inSensible of her danger j she, even in her own imagination, hastens on the awSul moment, wishing for it with eagernefs: her intel-leds are perfedly clear, and her mind G 6	unruffled.
I

unruffled. This day she has made a request by CuSack, who is the only perSon admitted to her lord, that he will not refuSe her one last interview. He has not reSuSed it: I dread to think how it will end. The time she has fixed for his visit, is four in the aSternoon: I am requested to be preSent, the counteSs having made it Her particular desire that neither the ladies of her family nor lady Emma will assist at the Solemn interview.
It was a considerable time before she could prevail on them to be ab-Sent, but her importunities were at length irresistible.
I think this may be called the School of resignation : she here presides in every heart, and her lessons are received without murmuring.
How
[ 133 ]
How dull then must be that Scholar who cannot make Some proficiency, Surrounded by Such examples! I know not which Succeeds in obtaining this perfedion with greater rapidity, Mrs. Archer or the counteSs; but, as the former is So young a student, in her, I ConfeSs, it appears most extraordinary.
She has never told her reaSons for declining the ladies prefence, when she Sees her lord; but I am Sensible they proceed from exceSs of tender-neSs: she knows their hearts will Suffer Severe conssidls; she considers too, that their fondneSs for her will unavoidably draw reflexions on the, author of her Sufferings: she wishes the earl iHay not be upbraided; she
wishes,
[ 134 J
wishes to See him with Serenity, that, . unruffled, she may pronounce the pardon her heart didlates. " TheSe, I am conScious, are her motives.
Lord Gore is the most lovely infant I ever beheld. Happy inSensible! he bids defiance to care; he Smiles, even in the face of Sorrow!
His lordship, since I came, has been removed to another apartment ; a change in which Mrs. Archer was peremptory; for whilst he remained with his mother, her eyes were perpetually moistened.
Lady Rainsford just now made me the following request. That when her lord is preSent, I will fetch the child, at a particular motion of her hand, towards the nurSery.

The curtains were not cloSed with Such exadnefs, but, looking that way, I could perceive her languid eyes and emaciated hands lifted up to the Supreme Being, intreating, no doubt, his protedtion, and a Speedy releafe from her asslidions.

LETTER LXII. Cusack to Colonel Onslow.
J AM commanded, Sir, by your lady, to relate the particulars of an unexpedted affair, which has thrown this family into the utmost consternation, and of which I happened to be a fpedlator.
A chaiSe and fix, the horSes foaming with expedition, drove, or rather stew, to this houSe: I Saw it stop at the door, and Sir Edward Onflow
immediately

immediately alight, with a lady in his hand, of whom I had then no idea.
Before I had power to meet him, he was with me; and I Soon recol-leded his female companion was no other than MiSs Saxby, notwithstanding her hat was pulled very low over her face. Ah, Sir, well may she be ashamed to expoSe a face, in which the guilt of her heart is strongly delineated !
CuSack, Said Sir Edward, this woman is your prifoner; guard her as you would do the most precious trust of Heaven; guard her as you would your own life. Where are the ladies ? Where is your lord ^ Shew me to them instantly.
I told
[ '43 ]
I told him the earl was in the coim-teSs’s chamber, and Mrs. Onflow with them; for I did not understand the contrary, though it Seems your lady had left them together, unable to Support the astlidling interview.
He then aSked for lady Emma:' I Said her ladyship was shut up with Mrs. and MiSs Archer, to avoid being prefent at the Said meeting.
He bid me carry up his name to the ladies, and fay, he begged permission to attend them ; but countermanding theSe orders, he aflced if I could shew him my young lord.
I will fee the child first, continued he; if I See him in the preSence of the Samily, my emotions may distreSs them.
I replied,

I replied, I was ready to conduct him to the nurSery.
He bid me go on; and placing MiSs Saxby in a chair, he Said, with an angry and commanding aSpedt, Sit there, madam, still you are Summoned to appear before thpSe you have injured : though you have not yet condescended to honour me with ♦ a single word, I shall now Soon find a method of restoring you to your Speech. Trust me, woman, all this Sullen reServe shall not Save you from the black confession.
Saying this, he locked the door, put the key in his pocket, and followed me to the apartment of my young lord.
Never shall I forget with what inexpressible fondneSs, with what parental

rental tenderneSs, he caught the child to his bofom. Whilst he kissed the Smiling infant, whilst he dandled it in his arms, whilst he strained it to his friendly heart; my poor lord, ifi a fit of deSperate rashncSs, burst into the room, cried, Draw, villain; and, without waiting still Sir Edward could recover from his astonishment, run him through the body.
Thus far I am commanded to write, and shall no longer preSume to intrude upon your patience; only, my good Sir, as the brother of Sir Edward Onflow, to whom I have been ever warmly attached. Suffer me to Subscribe mySelf your most obedient and devoted Servant,

O, my dear, the earl is really to be pitied: much to be pitied! his in-telledls never were impaired; but he has been cruelly deceived. Such Scenes of deep-laid villainy! Such monstrous impositions I Good God ! how happily are they unravelled! ‘ yet, how fatal had like to have been the conSequence!

Wonder not at what I have Said; I am hastening to lay before you strange mysteries; you shall hear all bye and bye.
Just as I was preparing to relate a tender, distressing interview, between the earl and his counteSs, a violent Scream alarrr>ed me: I concluded lady Rainsford was dead, that she had expired in the arms of her huS-band; and, as fast as my tremshiing feet would carry me, flew to the a-partment from whence the cry issued.
Here let me pauSe a moment;: how shall I deScribe the Scene that followed?
I rushed in, full of eager concern : there I found Sir Edward extended on the floor, weltering in his blood! Cu-Sack stopping his wound f Lady Emma H 2	fainting

fainting by his side ! and the earl, •with a Smile of cruel vengeance, gazing on them! in his arms, lord Gore! in his right hand, the horrid Sword, just warm and diScoloured from the boSom of my amiable brother 1
Ah, my God! cried I, kneeling by them, and frantickly tearing my linen, to stop the effusion of blood, Who has done this? What cruel monster has done this ?
Behold that monster, replied the carl with an enraged accent! I am he! Not all the blood of your perfidious brother, madam, can wash away the stain with which he has dishonoured me.
Dishonour’d you, my lord! SirEd-

Yes, he! my own curSed imprudence aiding! Margaretta, I bid you love him ; but, good God, did I!
He Sard no more : he had Said enough : he hurried from us, carrying lord Gore with him.
Did I want a fuller convidion, that he had entertained Suspicions injurious to the honour of his coim-teSs, and my brother ?
What does all this mean, cried I ? Whence thefe doubts ? O Heavens! by what vile insinuations did he entertain them! I cannot deScribe my own emotions; I will thereSore go back to the occasion oTmy being a witneSs to the Scene I have related.
Lady Emma accidentally passing the door just as the blow was given, they were her Screeches that alarmed mc;
H 3	but
*

but before I reached the room, she Was Sunk down, lifeleSs, by the side of Sir Ed ward.
Fainting with the loSs of blood, he was inSenSible to her tender Sorrow; he was inSensible to the Secrets of her heart, which, in this moment, were all involuntarily diScloSed.
' Lady Emma was the first who recovered : she Saw him still fenSeleSs; and, disregarding every other perSon preSent, she wept over him; she called upon him with Such distradled. Such pathetic grief, as Spoke him fervently beloved.
But no Sooner did he open his manly eyes, and fix them passionately on the objedl dearest to his Soul, than her lovely face was covered v/ith
blushes.
[ 151 3
blushes, and she fiew from the apartment.
Angelic creature ! her lively SenSi-bility and extreme modesty how Sweet' ly blended!
Happily lady Rainsford did not hear the alarm when my brother fell; neither does she yet know her lord’s rashneSs, or the discoveries by which it has been Succeeded.	,
Sir Edward being put to bed, his wound examined and dressed by the Surgeon who attended the counteSs, my agitation began to abate, and my Ipirits were cheered with the assurance of his being in no kind of danger.
As I was Sitting near hi$ bed, every one elSe being retired, except CuSack, whofe affliflion for the con-H 4	duel;
[ 'sT 1
du(5l: of his lord Seemed unutterable; he took my hand, and Said, in a weak voice, Sister, I am injured ; Rains-ford SuSpedls my honour. Go to the v/oman below; CuSack will bring you to her; force her to confeSs.
He could fay no more; but beckoning to his pocket, CuSack understood his meaning; and taking a key from thence, desired I would follow him.
I was all astonishment; and, as I went on, enquired of what woman my brother talked, and to whom he meant to condudl me.
When I heard it was the infamous Saxby, my heart danced with pleaSure.
Give me the key. Said I; pray, do you go back to my brother. Leave, I intreat you, the managemenfof this wretch to me.
The

The good man did as I desired. Forward I went; and, unlocking the door, darted in upon the vile girl with So much precipitation, that site started, and turned pale at my appearance.
Madam, Said I, without giving her time to recover from her diSorder, prepare to anSwer for your crimes, before a tribunal from whence you have no pity to expe<5t. You have Sown distention in a noble family you have been the occasion of Sir Edv^ard Onflow’s death; yes, you have been the occasion ; the law considers you as his murderer. Prepare, now, for your reward : the officers of j.ustice are at hand to drag you to a loath Some priSon.

The wretched incendiary, as I pronounced thefe words, calculated to intimidate her, fell prostrate at my feet, and, in the most abjedb terms imaginable, beSought my compassion.
What can you hope P What would you ash, Said I ? If you Sue to have your punishment lessened, or deferred even for a- moment, confcSs freely ; eonfeSs before the earl, before Mrs. Archer, before lady Emma, the vile arts you have employed to Sow hatred between a hushand and a wife, who doated on each other; between friends vsho loved like lord Rainsford and Sir Edward Onssow. It is only on theSe terms you can expedl the least indulgence. Hark, continued I, the officers of justice are coming to Secure you!
I will
[ »55 J
I will Say, I will do any thing, more terrified than before : Save me;
Save me, madam, and she clung about my knees for protedlion.
I shook her off; and going outside the door, which I fastened after me, pretended to Send away the men, returning back again with the most determined look I could assume.
Now, madam, Said I, for the pre-fcnt you are Safe; but remember the conditions : give me your hand; I will lead you to the family you have injured ; to them you must attone by an ample confession : you have no other way of avoiding the punishment that threatens you.
She shrunk back, and protested she would rather die than appear before them.

I considered a moment, and then‘ told her, if she would be ingenuous, and confeSs all her crimies, in a letter to the earl, that should Suffice; after which, I would Suffer her to eScape ; Otherwise, I would deliver her up to justice immediately.
The conSciou5 wretch joyfully caught at this propofal: I lost no, time; I placed her, trembling, at a deik.,, laid paper before her, put the pen in her fingers, nor stirred one instant from her side still I Saw the important tash completed.
Ah, what conviction is^ this, for the earl!
It was near eleven at night before she finished her confession; after which, unable to bear her in my.
' fighV'
[ >57 ]
Sight, and, in purSuance of my promise, I Suffered her to eScape.
It could have been of no Service to detain her; on the contrary, it might have been attendedwith the most disagreeable circumstances. When the carl had found how much he had been abuSed by her arts, had. she been still in the houSe, in the height of pashon, might he not have done her Some violence ? I think, on all accounts, it is best that she is Sent away.
I am extremely anxious to know how my brother brought her hither for though I was no stranger to his having got a glance of her in lord A——’s chariot, and that he was making diligent Search after her,, yet I did not imagine he would have been So very Soon fucceSsful, or that;
hiSr
[ rsS ]	. ,
he fuSpeDed her of any other crime than Seducing the affedlion of his friend : however, it is plain; from what he Said when he Sent me to the wretch, that he had discovered her real baSeneSs.
There is nothing strange in this penetration ; I have even the vanity to declare my own equal to his- for after the earl betrayed, in my presence, Something like Suspicion-in his counteSs, I Saw the whole affair in its proper mode; that is, 1 Saw he was jealous of Sir Edward ; and a moment’s resiection convinced me, that his wicked ward must have Sown in-his boSom the Seeds of that destroying passion.
I
lit
[ 159 ]
In conSequence of this opinion, I made uSe of artifice to force from her the horrid truth.
My brother approves of all I have done, and would have immediately informed me by what means he got the girl in his power; but I did not Suffer it, lest too much Speaking might fatigue him.
Thank God, he has had a charming night; his wound is quite eaSy ; he has not one Symptom of a fever; the tranquillity of -his mind will, no doubt, hasten the establishment of his health.
I have fat with him the wshole night; and though he was extremely importunate that I would relate the bkckest confeshon ever made by tongue or pen, yet I prevailed on
him

him to SuSpcnd his curiosity still the morning, when I have promiSed tO' bring all the ladies to his apartment, and to diSclofe it in full assembly.
May that Sun, which, from its> eastern chamber, darts, even now, its Salutary beams on this family, never more withdraw, still it has witnessed to their returning happineSs.
Sir Edward still steeps; it is yet early : before he av/akes,. I shall transcribe MiSs Saxbyst letter.
How will your heart shudder! yet how, too, will it rejoice, when, in the Same epistle, you See the bane which, has poiSoned lord Rainsford’s repofe, and the antidote by which it is restored !

AH. my lord, what shall I fay?
how confeSs my guilt ^ Yet, I must confeSs it; justice purSues me; repentance overtakes me. Your lordship—how I tremble 1 your lordship has been deceived ; and 1 am a very baSe, wicked, abandoned creature; the very worst of wretches !
Yes, my lord, your counteSs is innocent ; Sir Edward Onstow never
wronged
[ 1^2 ]
wronged you : lady Emma has not atsted unworthy of your sister. What a detestable, vile creature, have I been! to what lengths in vice have I proceeded ! my crimes are all ranged before me ! I was never So terrified;
I will hide none of my detestable proceeding: yet, good my lord, after I ■ have revealed them, do not bring me to justice; when I am gone from hence, do not purSue me: if I die, my death will give you no SatisfaDion. You are above revenge, my lord; Suffer me to live ; if I live, 1 may repent: for pity’s Sake, for mercy’s Sake, let me eScape.
Where, in my horrid recital, shall I first begin ?
Before I became your lordship’s ward, before you received me from
the
[ ] •
the hand of my expiring father, my Sedufbion was compleated. The villain who Seduced me was that George, whom I afterwards recommended to your lordship’s Service.
How very deceitful*have I been!
My amour with this fellow was discovered by the counteSs and lady Emma in your lordship’s abSence from the castle; but I had the art to impoSe on them So far, as to raiSe no Suspicions of my virtue.
As a penitent, diScreet girl, they did not think me unworthy of pity:
. they condescended to reaSon with me on the imprudence of my condudl:; and, not knowing the Swift progreSs I had made in vice, thought me not past reclaiming.
Believing
[ ]
Believing my protesttitions of re-morSe, crediting my counte;feit tears of penitence, they promifed, at my earnest intreaties, to conceal my folly from your lordship; and, for the benefit of example. Sent me to Mrs, Archer.
What ought to have Secured my gratitude, drqw on them my revenge. I hated them for having discovered my imprudence; I was in their power, and for that reaSon hated ■ them : I hated them too, becauSe they had not dishonoured tbemfelves as I had done; becauSe they were good and virtuous, I vile and depraved.
After being a few days at Mrs, Archer’s, I found means of corresponding with my betrayer, who, from considerations of tenderneSs to me,
the
[ »6S ]
the counteSs w^ould not discharge in your lordship’s abSence.
How unworthy was I of her good-nefs I
George did not Seem leSs diSpoSed for revenge than mySelf; we concerted our meaSures accordingly : w^e knew nothing could accomplish it So well as robbing the counteSs and lady Emma of your lordship’s affedlion; and, rather than not effedually disturb their repoSe, we were obliged to make your lordship a party in their Sufferings.
Recolle<5lion makes me blush: I once gloried in my baScneSs; I now weep at its remembrance.
Pray, my lord, have pity upon me; do not purSue me: I cannot run far; if I should be overtaken, I know my 1	.	-	J' le
I
[	i66	}
life will be forfeited to justice. Once more, I intreat your mercy; indeed, I will be explicit; i will hide nothing from your lordship.
If you recoiled, my lord, you came to Row-Park Soon after me; and not being expeded, your preSence a good deal Surprised the family, and immediately filled my imagination with the most wicked designs.
Your lordship knew nothing of my visit to Mrs. Archer, but did not appear diSpleaSed wshen that good lady told you the counteSs Sent me thither at my own request, and that she intended keeping me with her Some months.
You cannot have forgot, my lord, that when she Said this, I applied my handkerchief to my eyes.
Mrs.
[ 167 ]
Mrs. Archer was pleaSed with my pretended conSciouSneSs ; to what elSe could she attribute the emotion I Seemed under ?
It was studied, studied with the worst intentions, and anSwered them all with exadlneSs. My confusion did not eScape your lordship’s observation; I designed that it should not; and the next day, being by ourfelves in the garden, with your accustomed good-neSs, you pressed to know what it was that made me uneaSy.
I artfully evaded your question, yet my malignant heart danced with pleafure when I heard it propofed.
My anSwer was deferred So long, ^dll your curiosity became much inflamed, and your lordship Swore you would be informed.
Da
[ i68 J
Do you remember this, my lord ?
I looked down, then raiSed my eyes from the ground, and fixed them compassionately on your face. I Said, Sighing as I Spoke, No, my lord, do not insist on my Saying more; if I die, I will not give you pain.
But why, Nancy, replied your lord-ship, did you weep when Mrs. Archer told me you came hither at your own request ?
I wept to think I could not stay at the castle in the abSence of my honoured guardian, at least with Satis-fadlion to my Self. Indeed, my lord, this is the true cauSe of my tears.
You Seemed astonished, yet not e-nough agitated for my purpoSe. You alked if the counteSs or lady Emma i«.-d riven me a;-;' rtvi-rn for di'pleaSure.
[	1^9	]
Not on my own account, cried I, again casting down my eyes; but, my dear guardian, let us drop a Subjedt that distresses me.
Now arrived the moment to which I look forward with impatience. Ah, how your lordship’s countenance changed! I obferved the alteration with pleaSure, and purSued my undertaking without remorSe,
The perplexity which appeared on your lordship’s face produced Sroni me further insinuations. But why am I So minute ? your lordship can have forgot none of them ; no, I Saw them rivetted in your very Soul.
Though I did not impeach the virtue of your counteSs, L rendered her at least SuSpedted of a too tender regard for Sir Edward On stow; and if I VoL.II.	I	did
[ 170 ]
did not absolutely fay lady Emma encouraged that passion, yet, by dark hints, I accuSed her of being criminally blind to its effeds.
My next step was to get a w'ritteti pardon from the counteSs for my imprudent condud whilst I was at the castle; and fortunately, beyond my expedations, she Sent me one, with which I Sealed her ruin.
This billet came, unSuperScrlbed, in a letter to Mrs. Archer; the purport of it, that she forgave my indiscretion ; that she pitied what I felt from that indiScretion; that she referred me to our best friend, (meaning Mrs. Archer) but mentioned no name; that she hoped one day to Say, without a blush, I was dear to her ; promising, on certain conditions, still
to
i
t >7* ]	'
to obferve a profound Secrecy to your lordship.
Entirely devoted to miSchief, I diSpatched This letter to my agent, bidding him find Some favourable moment to inflame your lordfliip’s jea-louSy, by making you believe the contents addressed to Sir Edwai'd Onflow ; and alSo to insinuate, that the perSon mentioned as the best friend, was lady Emma CheiSea.
Every thing Succeeded to our wicked wishes; all our vile endeavours v/ere anSwered; you was corivinced of their perfidy; you left the castle.
Still our vengeance on the coim< teSs was not compleat; it could not be completed still we had filled her foul with the most jealous emotions;
I 2	and
[ 172 ]
and I even made mySelf the objedt of that jealouSy.
This we accomplished in the Sol-lowing manner. When I eloped from Mrs. Archer’s, and went, with the vilest of men, into Scotland, I left ■behind me a billet on my .dressing-table, written in your lordship’s hand to exadbneSs, in order to take all Suspicion from George, and confirm the ladies opinion, that you had adlu-ally left lady RainsSord, only to carry on your amour with me.
To fix it beyond a doubt, my accomplice, just as he left the castle, burst into the counteSs’s preSence, and, on his knees, with Seeming contrition, confirmed her wretchedneSs.
I have Since, my lord, been Sufficiently punished by the villain who
led
t 173 ]
led me from the path of innocence : O, he has Served me cruelly! But I deServe it all, indeed I do.
'	After making'himSelf lawful ma'
ster of my perSon and fortune, from Scotland^ he carried me to France, where, in a little time, he deSerted, ' and left me even destitute of neceffa-ries. Lord A--------- pitied my situ-

Ah, madam, you are too good ! As my brother, you Seek to excuSe him ; merely on that account, he must not be excuSed: is the light more obvious than are his crimes ? Whilst I See the one, I cannot be blind to the other. Aik my excellent sister, if a tender, affedionate hulband, has reduced her to the extremity of life: ash Sir Edward Onssqw, if an innocent hand pierced his friendly boSom : .ash, if my tears are Spent for a kind, honourable broth«r.
SuppoSe, returned I, theSe questions v/ere to be ashed; SuppoSe I should put them to the counteSs, to Sir‘Ed* ward, to yourSelf, what anSwer may I exped r how would it be given ^ Thus: No.
Pardon

Pardon me, lady Emma, that would not be your anSv;er; you would allconfirm him tender, affedionate, in--nocent, kind, honourable; iSnot, my life should be the forfeit.
She started from her pillow as I pronounced theSe words; and cried cut, throwing her fair arms about me
I Sat, Tear not my Soul with SuS-pence : could you Speak thus, could you look thus, if Rainsford really was the wretch he appears to be? For God’s Sake, Say; is it possible he may be innocent?
I Saw the agitation of her Spirits;
unwilling to augment it, I. heSitatcd
not; I related every particular; I
concealed nothing from her. I can-
<
not deScribe her joyful perturbations; a thouSand times, she embraced me :
I 5	I helped
[ >78 1
I helped to huddle on her cloaths: we went to Mrs. and MiSs Archer; ah, how exquisitely did they share our transports! We congratulated each other; we mingled our tears together.
Yes, my dearest hushand, all must, all will, end happily.
About ten, the ladies, at my request, met in Sir Edward’s chamber, where the confessional letter was again read in full assembly. I shall paSs by all comments made on this occasion; they were Such as may be imagined by a Speculative and virtuous mind.
Charming lady Emma 1 how amiable is her behaviour to my brother! Happy, happy brother! under .the guiSe of friendship, she conveys to him a thouSand proofs of a more lively and tender passion.!

After mature deliberation, it-was . first determined that the diScovery should not be made to lady Rainsford still her lord had confirmed it. Next, that Mrs. Archer should incloSe the letter to his lordship from MiSsSaxby, preparative to a family interview, which we have now the most flattering expedlations he will no longer avoid.
Mrs. Archer intends to write the earl at the fame time that she Sends the other letter. She is now in her.cloSet, and has promiSed me a fight of what she writes. Perhaps I may be allowed the favour of transcribing a copy for your peruSal: I go ini hopes to procure it.
I return without having my requesh granted : do you afk from what rea^^-I 6	Son ?;

ever since I have been at Buck-man Chace, weeping Seems the established busineSs of my life; I weep from morning to night. Sometimes my tears are the children of joy; Sometimes they are the offsprings of Sorrow. This moment I shed them unSparingly, but. I shed them with inexpressible gladneSs.

TheEarl of Rainsford tq the honourable Mrs, Archer, inclofcd in the preceding.
J^ISTRACTED with shame, re-rnorSe and horror, I rejedt, most honoured, most revered of women, the indulgence you are diSpoSed to offer.
You cannot fee your children reunited: lam unworthy to call you mother; unworthy to call the woman, on whom my Soul doates even i to madneSs; unworthy to call my dear, my injured Margaretta, wife.' • Yet, O my God! witneSs what I have Suffered! how I have been betrayed, cheated, abuSed I	,
My
' [ ]
My sister too! O, Emma, I alk you not to forgive me ! But, my mother, my wife, my Sister, my friend; this once allow the fond appellations ; do not hate the memory of RainsSord.
Yes, it is unavoidable; you must hate it, unleSs, when he has related the arts uSed for his deception, justice should plead the cauSe of pity.
I refledl not with Such diSgust, Sudh horror, on the contrivers of my ruin, as on that weak, shameful credulity, which completed it. I ought to have dishelieved the evidence of my fefiTes, when they witnessed against the virtue of my wife, against the honour of my friend, against the probity of my sister; yet, I caught even its shadows to distreSs them. The conSequence will be fatal to mySelf; I have colie died
[	.84	]
lefled an inexhaustleSs fund of torment and reproach.
When. I Sufipeded. the virtue of your daughter,-, madam,, my offence was against virtue, 1 might almost, fay, against it in her ov/n Sacred per-Son. 1 Seek not to excuSe my crime,, yet, the circumstances which cauSed it ^ were many, were Sorcible : Heaven itfelf Seemed combined to ashst the
I
enemies oS my repoSe: but stiU L ' cannot forgive mySelf, I cannot hope to be forgiven.,
I left you, madam, with a mtind poiSoned by the treacherous insinuations of my ward : her letter has told you by what means she admi-nistred the fatal draught, which operated beyond my reaSon. Thus distempered, I returned to the castle;
Oiifiow
I
1 ^^5 J
Onflow was there; he met me with his accustomed cordiality: my wife and Sister flew to my embraces, but their caresses were poinards to my Soul.
Afliamed of my own emotions, I retired early to my chamber; and the next morning, when I awoke, finding the counteSs gone from me, it occurred to my tortured imagination, that she had got up and left me, to walk v/ith Sir Edward.
I lost sight of my fears on this account ; when, going to her cloSet, I found her there, and Saw That she had been writing; yet still I could not entirely banish the fatal idea I had imbibed from the worst of wornen.
The counteSs, in our conversation, talked of MiSs Saxby; I received a
Sensible
[	i86 J
Sensible shock from the mention of ' ' her name; I even imagined it v/as-pronounced by lady Rainsford vvith; confusion : all the vile wretch’s horrid insinuations came fresh to my memory : I felt mySelF strangely agitated; 1 did not Speak; I know not how I looked, but it was in a manner which terrified the beloved of my Soul.
The Sorrow she betrayed, and her Sweet expressions of tenderneSs, made me forget every thing, but that I was the cruel occafion of her tears. I reproached mySelf; I pressed her to my bofom; I Said, in the agitation of my mind, Margaretta, my dearest Margaretta, never can deceive her Rainsford.
After
i
[	1^7	]
j . After this interview, if my Suspicions were not entirely eraSed, they were at least more governable ;, and when she could not be prevailed on to go without me to Southampton, notwithstanding Sir Edward was of the party, how did I exult! how exquisite were my transports!
Ah, thought I, why have I tormented rnySeif So long with imaginary evils? MiSs Sax by has deceived her-Self and me: perhaps she has entertained a Secret passion for Onssow; and may not the preference, the re-Spetstful preference, not only he,, but all mankind, pays my Margarei:ta, may not that alarm 1ier love, her pride, and her SuSpicion ? I will disturb mySelf no more ; it is jealouSy has made her too quick-sighted.
I was
[	388	]
I v/as walking with the counteS> when theSe pleasing, flattering reflections occurred; and, in the paffionate fondneSs of my Soul, I earnestly pressed her to tell me if she imagined Nancy. Saxby privately loved Sir Edward.
She was confuSed I ah, how ami^ able her confusion! She knew the unworthineSs of my ward ; she knew the merit of my friend : she was unacquainted with my true motives for this question; how then could she SuSpefl;, but that 1 washed an alliance, at w'hich her delicacy started ?
I am no longer blinded by Suspicion ; I now See her perSedtions, and my ov/n folly, in glaring colours.;, but, under the infatuation of a peace-devouring passion, I misconstrued every thing.
I: Said,
[	*59	]
1 Said, madam, that Heaven Seemed combined in league with the enemies of my repoSe. Sir Edward was. Soon after, taken ill; the counteSs coming by his apartment, and terrified by the cries of his Servant, ran to get him drops: I met her, pale, and almost breathleSs : she told me the accident; she repeated it with tears : at another time I should have kissed them from her cheek, but now they increaSed my torments. I did not confider her as weeping for the friend who, she knew, was dear to my Soul, but, as a man for whom I SalSely imagined she felt a guilty preference.
This opinion, deeply rooted, was, in a few hours, confirmed, even beyond a doubt. How can I proceed ?
how
t 19° ]-
how deliver the shocking relation ?
My Soul shivers at the talk !
Onflow was not recovered from his indisposition, when one day happening to paSs through the gallery lead-	I
ing to his chamber, I there met the	1
abominable accomplice of my ward.
Seeing me, he started; and shuffling a paper into his pocket, hurried on,
, as if he would avoid me. I Sprung towards him; I caught hold of his arm, and demanded the paper he had concealed. O, how artfully did the vstlain prevaricate, still, with my '
Sword unsheathed, I threatened him with instant death ! Then it was he fell upon his knees, addressing me thus, whilst he trembled with pretended apprehenfion and remorSe :
Ah,
• !
t J9I ]
Ah, my lord. Spare my life, and I will conSeSs!
Great God ! I cannot be particular. The billet which my beloved coun-teSj diDated from motives the most iienevolent, the most compassionate, was produced against her, at the Same time that he declared it was delivered to him by lady Emma. I knew the hand but too well; I knew it was my wife’s: I readily believed it designed for Onssow, and that lady Emma was '' privy to my diSgrace. Horror unutterable Seized me; I stew distr4^ed-. ly towards the apartment of my /Supposed guilty counteSs, but reaching the antichamber, could go no further.
I funk into a chair; and, by the groans, which I could not SuppreSs, brought her to witneSs my situation.
I cannot
•[ 19^ 3
I cannot proceed ; recolle(stion tears my heart aSunder. I parted from my Margaretta, of all human beings the most completely wretched.
1 had but one care, it was to preserve unSullied the reputation of my wife: I preferred her justification to my own; and, withdrawn from all the world, except my faithful Cufick,
I have here dragged out fix months of torment, in Some proportion ade- . quate to my crime, becauSe that crime was altogether involuntary.
Sir Edward came hither to visit me; I would not See him; he even came to the door of my chamber, but was refuSed admittance. I Spoke to him in a stile which I thought he would understand. Elad he been a falSe friend, had he been a villain,
he
[ 193 ]
lie would have understood it; buC perfeDly sincere, and a man of un-fullied honour, it is impossible he could form the most faint idea of my meaning.
Affured that On stow had leSt the houSe, and reSolved to Satisfy my thirst for mifery, I followed him, unperceived, to the castle, and got into a retired part of the garden, through a private door.
I had not been long in my hidden retreat, when I perceived your daughter, madam, walking on the South Terras; and in a moment after, my Sister joined her, with Sir Edward. I was not near enough to hear their conversation, but lady Emma Soon withdrew, and left them together.
VoL. II. K	They
r 194 ]
They continued walking; the 'coun-teSs hung upon his arm; and I once Saw him lift her lovely hand to his mouth with a fervency that added to my distradion.
Think not, madam, that I mention this incident with the least remaining doubt; God is my witneSs, that I hold my beloved wife the purest, the most innocent of his creatures ; but ah, Mrs. Archer, have not appearances strongly combined to deceive me !
I had thoughts, at that moment, to rush upon them with all the indignation I felt; but fortunately for once, the hand of Providence withheld me, though it has since let me loofe to the fatal impetuosity of my
rage*
[	'9S ]
rage, I returned to Buckman Chace. CuSack can tell you in what a situation I returned.
You know the rest, madam ; the most abuSed of wives foi-getting her wrongs, attempted, by her prefence, to Surprize me into happineSs. I resisted her endeavours. Good God ! in what a light must I appear! kow brutally Savage ! My barbarity had no Sooner brought her even with the grave, than I felt, instead of gratifying my revenge, that I had added a keener edge to my asslidtions.
As she lay inSenSible, I stole to her apartment, to indulge the fond effusions of my heart; but finding it was to the sister of Sir Edward. I K 2	owed
[	196 ]
owed the indulgence of being admitted, my emotions were redoubled, and I fled the room 'with precipitation.
In my last interview with the counteSs, unconScious of my grovelling Suspicions, she mentioned Onflow with that warmth of friendship which uSed to be grateful to me; but then I could not Support it: I found mySelf affedled; and, to recover my diSorder, left the room, intending to return.
Hardly knowing where I went, I was got at a considerable distance, when, in passing the nurSery, I Saw my Sweet, Smiling infant, in the •arms of Onflow, who bestowed on him a thouSand careffes.
I can
[	07 ]
I can write no more; the wound I gave my friend is repeated in my own boSom,
LETTER LXVIII. Mrs. Onslow to Colonel Onslow.

K 3	Mrs.
[	.98	]
Mrs. Archer falls upon his neck: lady Emma flies to his embraces ;• So does the Sweet, tearful Fanny; whilst the venerable CuSack bends to embrace his knees. My beloved Son! my innocent brother! my ho^ noured lord! are the only Sounds which interrupted the silence of this pathetic Scene. I would carry my description further, but nature Soars above me.
Continuation.
PreSumptuous as it is, I must, I will, venture on the attempt. Does the counteSs love her lord with more exquisite fondneSs than I doat upon my Onflow ? Why then cannot I conceive what it was she felt in finding
[	199 ]
ing him restored to her deSerted arms .? And if I Sympathize in her glowing SenSations, Surely I may paint them with Some degree oS liveliness.
No. Sooner did the earl find his credulity forgiven, and that he was restored to the affeflions of every tender relation; than falling at the feet oS Mrs. Archer, he beSought her mediation with the counteSs. She raiSed, she embraced, she Smiled him into hope; and, at her own request, was immediately Supported p her daughter’s chamber.
In her abSence, lady Emma and mySelf remained with the earl: he would have gone to my brother; he mentioned him with the warmest
emotions
[ 200 ]
emotions of tenderneSs; but Said he should not be enough compofed ta Solicit the pardon of his friend, still he had obtained that of his counteSs^ He w^as not Suffered to wait long in fuSpence ; MiSs Archer, who went with her mother. Soon joined us: the lovely girl had been in tears; the Sweet Sun-shine of her foul was still beaming through them: she took the hand of her agitated brother; she raiSed it to her lips; A-gain, my dear lord. Said she, I must thank you for making us all happy. But what are my thanks ? Come with me : you love my sister; site only can reward you.
With what matchleSs grace, v/hat lively joy, did the earl expreSs his
gratitude
[ 20" ]
gratitude to Heaven ! Lady Emma Seized his other hand: they led; I followed, to the counteSs.
Mrs. Archer waited to receive him at the door: she took the hand which Fanny held; and drawing aside the curtain, discovered the most finished beauty my eyes ever beheld, in a looSe gov/n of white fattin. Sitting up in the bed. Supported by pillows, with lord Gore, in ail his infant lovelineSs, claSped to her maternal boSom. Instead of flying to the extended arms of his counteSs, v/hich had dropped one treaSure to embrace another; on a bent knee he remained. Silently gazing on her face, which glowed, at that moment, with love, joy, gratitude, and forgiveneSs.
Inimitable
.1 202 }
Inimitable pair! I find mySelf unequal to the taste; I am now convinced my aspirations were indeed presumptive : I may feel like you, but cannot Say what it was I felt.. I do not v/ant Sensibility, but I want the eloquent graces oS expression. ConScious inferiority forces me to silence. Adieu, my dearest hushand.

Dearest madam, how strangely capricious is my humour! I have no wish unSatisfied; yet feel a SenSation like afflidlion, restleSs, uneaSy, apprehensive. The carl has been absent only three weeks, and I hear from him often — his letters do not threaten me with abated love; yet methinks, in the stile of thoSe I have lately received, there wants Something of his uSual unreServedneSs. Pardon, best of men ! this ungenerous Snfpicion: you are all good ! you are all amiable ! I ac-cuSe mySelf! I only am to blame.

My lord will certainly enquire for his ward as Soon as he has received my first welcome; I am prepared, and shall tell him she is with you, though not on what occasion.
You know, my dear madam, George is the favourite and particular Servant of my lord; how then in his abSenct €an I venture to diSmiSs him without declaring for what offence ? Lady Lmma, who knew the whole affair, ad-viSes me to continue him till her bro-thcr’a return.

Nature has endowed him with Some talents above the vulgar; at his pen he is amazingly clever, and often Serves the earl in quality of amanuensis ; but, notwithstanding he finds the means? of making himSelf uSeful, I hope very Speedily to get him removed from the castle without Suspicion—?if at his diS-miffion, Nancy’s virtue is not Sufficiently guarded against his arts, nothing jean Save her from the fate to which she hurries. How strange is it that her father should take So little care of this, his only child’s education; amegie<st which my lord has often aS- ^ fufed me, proceeded more from indolence than want of arnderstatiding. loved him on account of Some trivial ' f t	favours ^

Her ladyship knocks at my cloSet door; instantly my charming sister shall it open to you. Nine o’clock, and my lord not come! Lady Emma leaves me to diSpatch a Servant. Ah !

Is it possible the silly creature can have betrayed herSelf to him in the late three days he pasted at..her aSylum? No! Such a Suspicion would be abSurd: from whom then can he have learnt her miScondiKst ? Perhaps he is ignorant of it; perhaps I mistook his meaning;

My lord came to me just now with a kind of gloomineSs on his jcounte-nance, which I have never before observed in the whole SeaSon of -my SeH-city. But ere I proceed with this interview, I must relate a circumstance that did not eScape me without Some uneaSineSs; it v/as this: Last night, on his arrival, I thought he met nor my endearments, or the caresses ot his sister and his friend, with his accustomed warmth. We had Scarce enjoyed his presence a moment, (at least to me it Seemed but as a moment) when he complained of fatigue, and retired to his apartment, refusing all refreshment, and desiring we would excuSe his indisposition, which made him unfit for company. I offered to attend shim, but he faid he would -by no
means
t 13 ]
mean? Suffer me to leave Sir Edward and lady Emma. They were So good to withdraw at an early hour; and as Soon as I found mySelf at liberty, I hastened to my lord, who was fallen into a Sweet steep; and by the caution I observed, his repoSe was not interrupted.
Awakened by the first dawning oS light, I stole gently from his arms; and having put on my cloaths, ssid Softly to my cloSet. I had just taken up my pen, when he came in quite • unexpedlediy; his brow was clouded, his air reServed, and his return to my affedlionate enquiries after his health, broken and hesitating. He placed himSelf by me, and aSked coolly, to ^whom I had been dedicating thofe moments of which he had been deprived?
[ '4 3
prived ? I told him, my intenfion was to have communicated to my, mother, how happy his return had made me i but now that I could enjoy his lord- . ship’s conversation, I should lay aside my design for a moment that could not So pleasingly be filled up. He made me no reply; but throwing; one hand careleSsiy over the back, of my chair, withdrew the other from mine, with a look So like indifference, that for a moment it startled me, yet the very next, I silently chid myfelf lor SuSpedling the least abatement of that tenderneSs, So long, fo well approved. Again I took his hand, and began to prattle of a thoufand little matters which I recollected to have palled in his absence; for when in conversation with thoSe we love, the molt trivial
will
i
[ 15 ]
will appear of importance. Amongst other things, I caSually mentioned the permiffi-on I had given Mifs Saxby to paSs Some months with you. I watched his countenance as I Spoke, and was greatly shocked to See the Sudden paS-Sion by which he Seemed agitated. I shall be unhappy, my lord, (Said I with emotion) if 1 have taken a liberty of which you disapprove : is it poshble I can have offended you, by complying with your ward’s request 1 As I Said . this, tfiere darted from his benign eye a flash of terrifying reSentment, which filled me with excessive horror; and falling back in my chair, I exclaimed. What can I have done, my lord, to draw orHrhe this unkind Silence, thoSe looks of killing diSpleafure} My Sensibility Sostencd him, or elSe his anger
was
[ 1
w'as riSen to this frightful magnitudey partly by the force of my own fears r be that as it may, I was Soon restored to my former Serenity, by the most tender and passionate foothings.
I ventured once more to repeat my hope, that I had not greatly diSpleaSed him; adding, I had many reaSons' why I thought a visit to my mother not at all improper for Mifs Saxby.^ Again, I thought his reply given in terms too ambiguous for our Security.' If (Said he) and there stopped, looking at me as though he would have glanced through my very Soul, if you: , have given this proof of your indulgence to my ward fro.m no other motive than what you profefs to me ; If you yielded only to her desire of attending ovlr beloved mother, why .D, should-
C u ]
should you fear my diSpleafure ? Can you doubt,, my lord, returned I, hesitating—No, no, interrupted he, preS-sing me to his boSom, I do not doubt my Mafgarctta; my dearest Marga-retta never, never can deceive her Rainsford. Alas I I had deceived him; I was too conScious that I had, and my face glowed with confusion happily my lord did not augment it by observation.
It, was in this interview that he men-
..c
tioned to me the threehappy days he stole from his affairs, to Spend with you at Row Park; and told me alSo of your and my dear Fanny’s Surprize at his unexpedSed preSence. We pasted a most delightful hour together, aSter which he left me to purSue my first intention; bidding me Say a thouSand
tender
[ ]’
fender things for him to his reverccf mother and amiable Sister^ but not a-i Word of MiSs- Saxby. He certainly has received a hint from Somebody; is he is a stranger to' her folly, from whence proceeded his unaccountable difpleaSure ? Was there not Ibmething exceedingly mysterious in his behaviour ? Perhaps he thought me too lavish of that power with which I was-entrusted; perhaps he expedied to have been conSulted, before I pre^ fumed to have granted Nancy’s quest: it is possible this might occasion his reSentment: but ah, madam 1 should this really be the cafe, should he be angry for a trifie like this, what has imbittered the Sweetest disposition iver man poffeffed ? Must I not expedt ikn envious cloud will often obScure
my
[ J
my brighter profpedts ? Well, if it should So happen, I will patiently Submit; nay, even then, may I not be happier than numbers of my Sex who are infinitely more deServing ? My lord cannot, will not, be premeditated- ' ly unkind.
Affure MiSs Saxby, my dear mother, that as long as she deServes youf protedljon, she may depend on mine, and alSo on lady Emma’s profound Secrecy. A letter is this moment brought to me from that unfortunstc,
1 hope I may add, reformed girl: I encloSe it, as I Suppofe she has not had the confidence to conSult you on it, the contents being confessional. I hope it is with a Sincere abhorrence of"them that she relates the circumstances of her diSgrace, O! that So \;rn	young
\
[ }.
young a creature should be So defign-' rng! So amazingly arttul! Her letter is really pathetic; her remorle touches: me; I repeat my hope, that she may not be insincere.
Lady Emma Summonses me to breakfast ; she tells me the uentiemen are impatient; but adds, Don’t hurry yourSelf, my dear sister, let them wait, let them taste disappointment; it is the only method we have of taming their lordly Spirits. Ah! lady Emma,,-what charming gaiety is your’s!—•—

MiSs Saxby to Margaretta Countefs of Rainsford, inclofed in the preceding.
Honoured Madam,
^OVERED with confusion, I fall at your ladyship’s feet, to confeSs the circumstances of that unhappy affair, which has brought me on the very brink of infamy. Unworthy as I am to approach you, madam, I will not preSume to addreSs you, but as a penitent criminal to a judge who is all mercy and forgiveneSs. Ah, my lady ! could you See with what blushing confusion my eyes are cast on this SpotleSs paper; could you See the trembling agitation pS my fingers whilst I pollute k with my pen; could you See the
Self-
I ]
Self-torment I Sustain, you would, I know you would, pity nie! But dare I complain ? Forgive this boldnels, madam, and Suffer me to proceed with my confession.
Unfortunate in the early loSs of my mother; in an education unSortunatc, alas! what has been the conSequence ? I mean not to refiedl on my father’s memory, or to extenuate my offence^ but to shew your ladyship how far I was initiated ki al^eDi meanneSs before your lord removed me to the castle, where the most improving examples came too late: I beheld, admired^ but could not imitate them. .	. pj
Unhappily for me, my father was ^ of a temper So very Sedentary, that after the death of my, mother, he Ser eluded himSelf altogether from the
world;
t 23 ]
world ; and taking me from shhool at thirteen, made me a sharer in his retirement, the first step to my undoingi This kind of Solitude, for a long time, was inSufferable to me; and having Something of levity in my disposition, I became intimate with the menials of our family : their conversation grew habitual; and what I had for Some time conSidered as a hardship, Soon wore the face of choice and inclination : I no longer repined at being debarred going abroad, or bringing company ho.me ; nay, when accident threw me amongst people of equal, or Superior rank with my own, I blush to Say, their presence always made me uneaSy, I looked on rational conversation as a toil; and to repay mySclf for the tedious moments So , bl. ^ w	passed.
i H ]
passed, flew to my father’s Servants for relaxation and amufement. One of the females received the addresses of a young man in the neighbourhood, and his brother, through their contrivance, was introduced to me. Need I tell your ladyship, this was the hateful, detested George, at whoSe name I shall ever shudder.
The fellow was tolerable in his per^
Son, insinuating in his manners : I was Seduced to an inexcuSable weakneSs; and, wretch that I am. Suffered him to talk to me of love without diSpleafure.
I Said I would confels all—yes, I will confeSs all; but dear, dear lady, keep it from my guardian, or I am ruined.
Our houshold steward, the most,
I may Say, only honest Servant my fa- ! ther had about him, on Some pretended
{	25	]
tended fault, I got discharged; and concluded my artifice, by establishing in his place the wretch Lhad received as my lover. After this Scheme w^as effedled, my father lived but a few days: lord RainsSord, who came to See, and happened to be with him in his last moments, condcScended to accept the office of my guardian.
This loSs, added to the weight of my imprudence, astlidted me beyond fneaSure. My lord conSoled me in the most tender manner ; promiSed I should find in him a parent; and in his own coach carried me to the castle, before the remains of my father were interred. O, madam, how was you deceived, when my lord introduced this faulty creature to you, and you declared yourSelf pleaSed with my ap-VoL. L	C	pearanc^!
[	2*5 ■]
pearance ! For a long time I beheld your ladyship with no other Sentiment than a reverence that was painful, being awed, if not diSgusted, by your Superior virtue; and often have you chid me with the affedlion of a sister,
' for a reServe I could not conquer.
I had been under your ladyship’s protection but a few weeks, when th« ^ author of my Scandalous folly found	i
means to convey to me a letter, de-1-	i
peratcly threatening his life, if I did not Soon get him introduced to my lord’s family. Dreading to exaSperate him, by refusing to comply with his request; fatally involved, and not knowing how to retraft, without laying mySelf open to a diScovery, I re-folved to Speak in private to my lord, aSraid to make my petitioiv before
your
[	27	[;
your ladyship, not becauSe it did not bear the appearance- pS innocence, but becauSe I was conScious of guilt.
I had Soon an opportunity of putting my design into execution, and recommended Geors;e in So advanta-geous a light to the earl, as a Servant my father greatly esteemed, that he had the goodneSs to receive him into his own particular Service, in which there was then a vacancy. Unrestrained by example or instruclion, I proceeded headlong to my undoing, with Such rapidity, that I had aftu-ally promifed to run with him to Scotland, when your ladyship discovered my wretched situation, and instead of Sinking me to perdition, compassionately raiSed me to repentance : you Sent me not where i am C 2	upbraided,
[ 2-8 ]
Upbraided, deSpiSed and avoUed, as I have deServed, but where I am hO'», noured with condeScending lessons^,. Such as the most faultleSs may receive, as instruftion. • It is not Mrs. Archer^s method to reprove with anger, but to, adviSe calmly. How good, how in-, dulgenf, to Send me hither! Indeed, , madam, one would think your mam,-ma"s precepts were as much diredled to MiSs Fanny as to me; yet at Such times, my naughty heart always Sends its blood to my face, to tell, as it were, which of the two has most reaSon to •apply them.
O! that, like MiSsjFanny, I could hear them attentively. Smiling, and without confusion I Your Sister, madam, has not deceived any body; she, has not debaSed herSelf,. her family,, t;'	and
[ ^9 ]
^nd- her Sex*.' I cannot Support the Contrast ! yet, 1 thank heaven, I am not fatally criminal; and if this indiscretion is kindly hid from the world,
I may once again lift up my down-cast Cyes with pkaSure; and I hope the confession I have made will be regarded as a sign of my return to prudence.
A reproof your ladyship once gave a little child in my preSence, strikes me at this moment: I think I can ' repeat the very words, and nothing shall ever blot them from my memory. Leading her tO' the orange grove, just as she had committed a fault, the Commission of which she continued to deny, your ladyship Said, with the most enchanting mildneSs, Observe this tree, Sally, then tell me if the blossom comes before the fruit,
L‘06	c ^	Qj.
X
[ so i
or the fruit before the blossom ? The child anSwered judicioussy, and her monitrest continued, Remerqber then, my dear, the inference you are to draw from this observation; when you . have been a naughty girl, and arc Sorry for your fault, you will reSemblc this fair tree; your confession of that' fault will be the blossom, your amendment the fruit. Ah, madam, I think I can anSwer for my heart, that it shall not put forth the blossom, witte outproducing the fruit alSo.
Dear, dear lady, continue to me your goodneSs, and lady Emma, I am Sure, will not betray me. If I durst ** . ofiCr one more request, this I wmuld kneel to obtain, that by a single line from your honoured hand, I may be told (if my future behaviour merits ^	that
Is*]
that forgiveneSs) you pity and forgive the wretch you have Saved from de-Str udion.

You cannot imagine, rnadam, how much I have involuntarily (as I may fay) obliged this most amiable of men! Wshen I have related the circumstances, you will know it was my own Satif-fadlion I conSulted.
Lord and lady Gage, who yesterday did us the honour of a visit, pro posted a month’s tour to Southampton, and pressingly invited us to be of their party. My lord was not preSent when this Scheme was first mentioned : Sir Edward embraced it with pleaSure; lady Emma was charmed with it; and for my part, having no objection, I pretended none; and we j^njoyed a thousand pleaSures in imagination,
which
[ - 33 1
which in our little excursion we hoped to realize. On the earl’s "entrance, he was acquainted with oiir intended ramble, no one doubting but he would enter into it with alacrity; but how were we all mortified, when he declared indiSpenfiblc buSinels would prevent him from attending us, yet infisted that I should keep my engagement, with an earnestneSs which disconcerted me. I knew his deSign was to give me pleaSure; but did he think I could enjoy any from So long. So unnecessary a Separation ? if this was his real opinion, he yet knows but little of the heart he governs. Sollicitations ^from every quarter called for all my resolution to resist, and it was not but with extreme difficulty that I got my-felf exeuSed..	■

Prithee Charles, didst thou fancy thyfelf giving the word of command in a military way ; to the right; to the left; ground your arms; recover your arms; prelent; fire r Hey day! and dost thou expe6t the Same obedience from thy friend as from thy Soldiers ? What a catalogue of questions ! Certainly my Sister had Some hand in them ; should she frown at the imputation, tell her, moderate curiosity is not more natural -	-	than

than becoming in the fair Sex. Let the expedition with which I hasten to obey, let that tell heir how very laudable I hold it, how much I honour ' the delicate Sensibility from which I know it ariSes.
Venerable shade of Sidney, assist thy Suppliant, lend him thy deScrip-tive genius ; teach him thy eloquence ; that he may not prophane the charms, the graces, the virtues, he wishes to immortalize !
Amazement and reSpedl are the first effedts of beholding ladyRainsford; her conversation Softens that refpect which esteem commands; her affability brightens it to joy, to love, to adoration; joy. Serene as the Smile of Spring; love, pure as the unpolluted water-fall; adoration, holy as the Saints: her fight inspires
t 39 ]
Spires you with all the generous, all the tender passions; you feel them warmly, but you Seel them divested of desire. So much for heroics, now for genuine description.
Her ladyship, tor size, colonel, comes near your standard, being very little under six feet, yet no Amazon; nothing that conveys to you any mar-tial ideas, but all that is captivating in female SoftneSs; all that is winning in Simplicity, she poffeffes in a Superlative degree.
Many fine girls have I Seen study fio appear what nature never designed them. I have Seen a handSome prude affedting SprightlineSs ; a coquette, refervedneSs; a wanton, modesty; but heavens ! how different is affedlation from nature! how different their studied

If, to obServe a particular objecst, she reclines her head negligently on either side, you wish her portrait to be taken in that position : again, she turns towards you, and with a profile you would be dissatisfied.
When she talks, the ear is taken captive by her v/it, the heart enraptured with her voice: there is in. it Something of Sweet harmony not to be expressed ; and she can boast this attraction, that when she but Speaks, her lord listens with greater tranSport than he could do to the finest Singer in the univerSe warbling she airs of Handel.
I wish as much could be Said of every i British hushand.	i

In short, all she looks, all she Says; ' -all she does, becomes her. Are theSe colours too faint to convey to you an idea of lady Rainsford ? Would you have me enlarge on the charms of each animated feature.^ What can I fay of them, but that they Seem formed, every one in emulation of the other.? Would you know in what manner she diSpoSes the delicate brown hair with which her fine oval face is profuSely ornamented ? I cannot tell you ; a negligence So beautiful is only to be Seen in the stile of your admired Vandyke, and baffles description. Am I expected to paint minutely the lovely windows through which her mind peeps out ? Iinpof-Sible! I cannot fpeak the Sparkling

Lady. Emma, withdravr your Sweet image one moment; I have not yet done with your angelic sister.
Angelic! truly angelic, is the Soul of our all accomplished counteSs; generous, enlarged, Sympathetic : her pleasures are to regulate her passions, to Set the brightest examples of prudence, of oeconomy, of conjugal af-fedlion ; and her only pain ariSes from a want of power to relieve thoSe di-streffes which are above the reach of fortune. Never were the first vestals more cautious to preServe the Sacred fire, than is lady Rainsford to make her adlions shine with virtue, piety, and all that constitutes perledHon. Let me perish, if I can think or Speak of

I am just r«eturned frora. that nobleman’s Seat, whither I yesterday attended lady Emma, and am gracioussy inclined to proceed with the talk you have assigned me. Fortune
[	44 J
tune is often propitious wshere it is leash expeded; greatly has she shewn her-felf in your favour, by Sending me back to Rainsford castle with fo little ceremony. A whole month’s credit to your curiosity; what struggles in that time it might have Suffered! However, no fear, 1 believe, of its exoirino-..
Though I am strangely impatient to bring you acquainted with lady Emma, many reaSons force me to give the precedency to her brother. I in^ tend her ladyship no diSrefped. You will believe me, when I give you an opportunity of kissing her fair hands, an honour I Seldom aSpiresto; but for you, who-are happily independent of greater favours; I hope I may procure that indulgence. At this moment the
image
[ 45 I
image of your good woman riSes to my imagination in all her domestic lovelineSs, and Seems to chide my levity. Back, back, dear sister, back £0 my heart, where you shall be warmly entertained, and assured of the Second, if not the first place in it.
After all, Charles, the life of a batchelor is but barely tolerable. Faith, to confefs the truth, I am tired of its insipidity, and shall not be eaSy still I get clear of the aukward situation .
A first love is the devil; disappointed in that, and the conSequence is a dishdence, a distrust, hardly to be conquered. I have a fstSceptible, but a doubting heart. Yes, I own I have Susceptibility: I cannot gaze on beauty with indifference, be inanimate to the ^ _	charms
"[ 45 ]	_
charms of wit, or give the Same cool praiSes to a fine Sentiment, ushered, through a Smiling, dimpled mouth, that I should do if it came from one unadorned by the Graces. Ah, lady Anne,, it is from you I have learnt caution! For your Sake I dare not gaze ; I dare not listen without Suspicion. Think me not, my brother. So much the prey of folly, as to harbour one tender idea of that ingrate : No !
I forget even that she was lovely!
I remember only, that she has deceived me! that she is unworthy the attachment of a man of honour.
Lord Rainsford received a first im- i pression from his counteSs; how happy the event! You bid me relate the riSe and progreSs of their loves : you have heard there are in them many strange
and
L 47 ]
and unexpected turns: you are not miSinSormed.
When my lord’s acquaintance commenced with MiSs Archer, I was a-broad ; but being honoured with his lordship’s unbounded confidence, he conveyed to me the particulars by letter. He writes with all the exaD-neSs of a lover: on every word, on every look of his mistreSs, he dwells with rapture. I write not with the pen of love, but friendship; wonder not, therefore, if I am leSs circumstantial.
My narrative Ihall be given you in a stile perfedtly laconic ; but first permit me to Set before you the natural and acquired qualifications of my story’s hero.
t 48 3
i- It would be highly abSurd for one man to deScribe thefeatures of another, wshich makes me wish my pen in the hand of Some female, not inSensibly stupid, who might talk of «yes, mouth, teeth, hair, without erring against propriety ; but wanting Such an assistant, I hasten to thoSe great qualities, in a repetition of which I want no aid : few can know them better; none have a higher veneration for them.
Born with an amazing genius for the nobler arts, the world cannot produce a more complete master. This Superiority does not show itSelf osten-tatioufiy, and on all occasions, but appears, at proper SeaSosts, through a becoming veil of diffidence, under which it is hid from vulgar eyes. His nature is frank, generous, unSuSped-
ing J
t 49 1
ingi with the grave he is Serious ; with the gay he is lively; to his friend he is unreServed; to his inferior condescending : there is not that perSon to whom he does not accommodate his humour; thoSe only excepted, whoSe conversation is beneath the dignity of a wife or virtuous man.
Not entirely to diSregard the many perSonal advantages of which he is poffeffed, I must inform you, his stature is majeftic, his perSon finely proportioned, his physiognomy pleasing; his addrefs not studied, but commanding ; not indolent, but eaSy ; not bold, but graceful: to music he is quite a . devotee, a very Orpheus; for though nature has denied him the voice of a Manzoli, his judgment has in it vrhat-ever is most Sweet and passionate in VoL.I.	D	hannony;
harmony ; besides^ which, he defigffS,
' he draws, paints, and dances to perfedtion.
Such is lord Rainsford; Such the man who, in giving me the title of his friend, exalts me to an envied height . .	of honour.
' Farewell, my amiable sister; farewell, my martial brother. With the
early dawn, expedt me again on duty.

jpANDORA has certainly opened
her box of evils in this neigh- I bourhood. I told you, madam, in ' rny last, that lady Emma ChelSea and Sir Edward Onflow had left us, and were gone to paSs a day or two at Gage-Grove, from whence they were to proceed to Southampton; but an unfortunate accident returned them to us quite uncxpedledly ,; it was the Sudden and Severe illneSs of lady Gage, who, just as the party was Setting otk on their expedition, fainted by tlie	!
coach fide, and continued So much	i
indiSpoSed, that all, thoughts of it were
laid	I

laid aSide. Lady Emma and Sir Ed-vrard came back to us last evening; and about three hours since, the latter Was Seized with violent Symptoms of immediate death; but, thanks to the great fkill of .Dr. Coverly, Seems now much recovered.
Certainly it was a particular ad! of providence for his preservation, that a Servant, unordered, went to his chamber, where he had been writing, and was fallen against the delk in a SenSe-leSs and deplorable Situation. I was just then passing by the door, which happened to be open ; and hearing the Servant cry out, I stepped forward, and Saw him striving to lift his master from the floor, GueSs, madam, how exceedingly I was alarmed ^ I felt for my Salts, but had them not about ;	^	.D 3	me;
t S4 ]
me; and v/as running back to my room for them, when I met my lord.
I told him the occasion of my concern, and never was a more Severe shock than what he Suffered I I wept to See hiS distreSs; never brother lov’d another as he does Sir Edward ! God j forbid death should step in to diffolve	|
a friendship So sincere and tender!'	i
My lord and I had yesterday another conversation, oS which MiSs Saxby v/as the SubjeD. I fancy he wishes an	I
union betv/een her and Sir Edward.	!
She has a fine fortune, and he, I Sup- | poSe, believes her amiable but this, cannot, must not, be. ' I’ll tell you, madam, why I imagine he leans to-Such a conne<5lion.
About an hour before the return of our friends from Gage-Grove, we
strolled
I
____ !
t 55 ]
strolled to meet them down the avenue, talking of the accident by which their Southampton Scheme had been frustrated, my lord, in that harmony of Spirits wshich never fails to exhilarate mine to a degree oS extacy. Never were the first pair more happy when straying in the fiowery walks of Eden, than your Margaretta, and her Rainsford, in this SweL.t excursion. I was leaning on his arm, and catching every word that dropped from his lips with lond attention, w’hen stopping of a Sudden,, he claSped me to him with an air that at once both charmed and Surprized me r Ha, my dearest life. Said he, gazing on my face with the rhost passionate eagerneSs, does MiSs Saxby love, privately love Sir Edward Onflow ? Say she does ; fay only you D 4	believe
T 5^ A
believe she docs; and--------there he
'stopped. I immediately Saw his wish;
I Saw too, that it never could be ef-fedted without doing Sir Edward an irreparable injury: I knew’not what to anSwer; I think I was never more confounded ; but after a moment’s Silence, I Said, forcing a Smile, Surely my dear lord can have no Serious intention, when he bids me tell him my Sentiments of his ward’s affedtions;
Do you mean to resign your trust to Sir Edward ?
He Seemed diScompoffd at the jesting manner in which I Spoke ; and Said a little angrily. If I meant it, I fancy	'
I should meet with Some obstrudlion	|
from your ladyship. Pardon, my dear i lord, returned I; far be it from hne to ! obstrudf any of yoiir views; gladly |
would
[ ,57 ,]
would I aflift them ; but indeed 1 be-lieve the pair you would wish to unite, are totally indifferent to each other. He Said no more, and, I hope, has dropped all thoughts of the affair.
Lady Emma has been much affetst-ed by Sir Edward’s illneSs. I might think her concern like .my own, if she did not take visible pains to conceal it. Her ladyship Sends to invite me to a turn in the garden. Now, if she is not, very fiy, I shall difeover whether I have any fkill in Silent language. The Same delicacy that forbids the tongue, cannot always restrain the eyes from Speaking, I am much mistalcen, if my Sister’s have not, within theSe four hours, been whiSpering of her heart’s concern. '
D5	I shall
t 5^ I
I shall never again plume mySelf on having acquired an art in which I am no adept. Lady Emma, in our last teteatete, has convinced me that my talent is not penetration. So Smiling,
So alert. So uncostcerned, it is impossible she can feel very acutely for Sir Edward; yet is he not better ! Did he not rest well last night ^ Does she not talk of getting up this morning ?
And may not her ladyship’s Spirits bq restored with his health ?
^ Lady Gage too is much recovered.
Dr. Coverly, who attends her ladyship, has accounted for the indisposition of both his patients, by the operation of Some poiSonous herb which they must have eat amongst other vegetables. Had I not a great opinion ^ of this gentleman’s judgment, I fiiould ' ^
think
\
1
[ 59 ■]
think their diSorder contagious, and that my lord had not eScaped infeftion-. Ever since Sir Edward’s Seizure, he has been excessively dejecsted; and when I told him yesterday, that his friend was pronounced out of danger by his phySician, he looked as if he thought tli« hope too flattering; he looked at me as though he was still doubtful; and Said, with a Smile whicfi had in it lest of joy than Sorrow, I wish not Margaretta to interrupt your SenSations of pleaSure by my SuSpicion. This backwardness to believe what we most wish, fiiews how difficult it is to elate the mind which has been once thoroughly depressed.
Was not Sir Edward So very amiable, I protest I should be uneaSy at the Swift progreSs he hourly makes in D 6	my

my lord’s affedion; even his steeping thoughts are full of his friend. It was but last night, that, starting from his pillow, terrified, I fuppofe, by what had pasted in the day, he cried out,

p^fTH,. Charles, three days since, thou hadst an excellent chance of Succeeding me in my hereditary ho- *	'
nours; but thanks to a good physician,,	j
and abetter constitution, no siich preferment now courts your acceptance.	j
In plain English; I have been violently	j
ill, but, like other violent things, the	I
force of my diSbrder was Soon. Spent..
I expedt your congratulations on ray	■
recovery ; from your heart they will	,
be sincere. I would not venture to	^
Say So much for every younger bro- ^ ther. No siattery, Charles ; thou T art too honest to blush at being poS-	j
Seffed of theSe .virtues, the want ot

[	63	]
which ought,only to make a man ashamed.
The counteSs is indiSpoSed, and confined to her chamber. Lady Emma tells me her diSorder is a cold, which greatly affeds herltead and eyes. The • earl never leaves her; lady Emma but Seldom : I mope about like one for-laken : I fly to my pen, as a reSource against the-Splben; and SuppoSing you at leisure to attend, as I am to relate, shall continue the recital which in my last I was obliged to break off abruptly.
At the time Mrs. A.rcher brought her daiighter to town, the old earl,
. who had buried his counteSs Some years before, resided with lord Gore and lady Emma ChelSea in St. James’s Place.
Though
'	I
I
[	64 J	^
Though past the grand	climatsteric,	'
love was his predominant passion; and this ridiculous^ humour for gallantry made his children extremely uneaSy, himSelf the objetfi: of derision.
Besides the follies of youth, there alSo remained in his mind a	tindlure of	'
thoSe vices to which at that feaSon he had been most additsted ; and it So hap-	?
pened, the first evening MiSs Archer	I
appeared at Ranelagh, his lordship	(
had efcorted thither Some ladies of	j
eaSy virtue, (lord Gore and lady Emma being on a party in the country)	f
the graceful figure and engaging lovc-lineSs of MiSs Archer commanded admiration. Lord Rainsford, like a
^
Second Sidrophel, pierc’d through his, glaSs at this star of beauty; he drops	’
his former associates, and becomes her	,
shadow.	I

Shadow. When she walks, he is in motion ; when she goes to a box, he plants hirnSelf before it; he folds his arms, he sighs, he ogles, and affeds all the grimace of real or pretended passion.
Jack Piggot gave me thefe, and alSo other particulars, which I am about further to relate of this memorable evening. You are not unacquainted with Jack’s talent for ridicule ; and I fancy ii was in Seeking after food to feed that humour, that he happened to be So nice an obServer of theuld peer.
The night being pretty far advanced, Mrs, and MiSs Archer retire to one of the outer rooms; my lord foL lows them, and Piggot follows my lord.	;
Whilst
[: 6S' J	i
V/hilst the ladies waited'still their carriage came up,, the. younger, out of that exceSs of modesty which shrinks , at being, too nearly obServed, drew'	i
over her face a hood cpmpoSed of	;
black lace. Setting off to exquisite acl- ^	!
vantage the delicacy of her com-	.
plexion. Jack, when he mentioned	'
this circumstance, told me, he looked	,
on thoSe kind of hoods to be a prettjr piece of mechaniSm, invented by Some, artful beauty, to let her eyes play bo-	j
peep at greater liberty, than in mo-	^
desty they could do without this cob-	i
web veil for an apology ; yet, added he,-let me perish if I tbink-Mifs Archer	'j
wore it- from any other motive, than . to avoid the tliouSand.glances that her	j
charms attradSed : every motion,, every	I
look, continued he, was So full of	h
Sweet
[	67	]
Sweet bashfulneSs, that when she went to her coach, my heart gave a joyful leap, as if it had eScaped from a dangerous encounter, which it could not have Supported in Safety many minutes longer. Return we to our story.
The father of my Sriend never wanted agents to tranSadt his private amours; and Soon discovered the name, rank, and character, of his charmer; which were all fo favourable, that he began to entertain very Serious designs of making her an offer of his hand ; but then that honour was not to be purchased by a girl with only a few thousands, at a leSs price than her whole heart: a coronet was to be the reward, not the bribe, of her compliance : she should not even know it was a noble lover who ad^i'effed her; and
to
I
t 63	]	‘
fo accomplish theSe designs, he detef’ mines to loSe his title in the plain appellation of Mr. Fellton, still he had gained his mistreSs; proposing, the moment	she	confessed a	passion	for	j
him, to Surprize her into an ardour of | gratitude, by a declaration of his high rank.
Do you notshake your sides, Charles, with laughing at the romantic Schemes • of this tottering, witheredOroondates?
Yet he really carried them into exe- | cution; and, in the abSence of his Son and daughter, got introduced, under his new eharadler, to Mrs. Archerst family.	I
I Said	he	intended	to	Surprize	his	1
eharmer into an ardour of gratitude, but she did not give his lordship an opportunity. An abSolute, but very
polite
t ^9 ]
|3oTite rejedion of his propoSals, So '^much disconcerted him, that he hastily withdrew from her preSence, in full poffeSsion of his important Secret.
ThoSe must know but little of heroic love, who can SuppoSe the SuScep-tible earl dtsisted at the first repulSe ; no; he reSolvcd to continue the attack; but began to fee, like a reasonable being, that if he would poffefs the perfon, he must purchaSe it on her own terms, and leave Heart out of the question.
Divested of his former romantic notions, his lordship, the next morn-ins:, returned to Mrs. Archer’s housh in all his glory. ^ Nothing could be greater than the astonishment of his fair one, on being told that her lover, Mr, Felltpn, was no other than the ;	mighty,
[ 7° J '	j
mighty, magnanimous earl of Rains- |j Nord. She started, she dishelieved the [ I evidence of her Senfes, and stood heSi- i rating between Surprize and confusion.
Never was a Scene of higher comedy. j Misconstruing her emotion for that of pleaSure, down at her feet dropped ; the most passionate oS lovers, vowing : he would never leave that humble posture still she had pronounced him happy. No, my lord. Said MiSs Archer, recovering from her disorder, if you refuSe to riSe, I must quit your preSence;. I cannot stay to wkneSs a humiliation So degrading to your lordship’s dignity.
Ah, divine creature! replied he, ; allow me then this Small favour; and
I
Snatching her hand, made the happi-neSs of touching it a timely plea for
helping
I
!
I 71 )
helping him from a station which, without ashstance, he could not So easily have quitted.
Whilst he was explaining his motives for the strangeneSs of his con-dud, which no doubt Were all derived from love, MiSs Archer listened with great affability; and when he had run himSelf quite out of breath in pursuing the Subjed, she made him this anSwer, neither, as my lord afterwards observed, regarding him with triumph or contempt; SweetneSs and modesty accompanied her words.
I Seel my heart. Said she, filled with reSped for your lordship, and gratitude for the honour you intend me ; but know, my lord, had you continued your affumed charader, it would have felt the Same reSped, the Same
gratitude.
[ ri J
gratitude. What I refuSed to Mr, Fellton, let lord Rainsford ceaSe to Solicit. It was not the fortune or the rank of the one I disapproved ; it is not to the riches or titles of the other that I can Sacrifice my inclinations: whenever I give my hand, I must feel the most undivided affedioo, the most tender preference for him with whom 1 unite my destiny; and a preference ij of this nature I have never yet experienced,	j
Never, madam ! interrupted my lord.
Never, returned she ; nor have I I entertained a higher opinion, or more reSpedl, for any who has yet addressed me, than for your lordship.
Though, upon many occasions, extremely ridiculous, the carl wanted
’	^ not
[ 73 ]
-not Sentiment where his nobler passions were touched with delicacy. He admired the steadiness of that reSuSal by which he was mortified. Though her indifference disappointed his hopes, her politeneSs flattered his vanity; and before he left her, he made one request, which she gladly complied with, that of admitting the visits of lady Emma. Her ladyship and lord Gore returned in a few days from their excursion in the country, v/hen the whimsical earl took it into his head to tell them the whole affair of his love, which they heard with the utrr.ost concern and astonishment, but flippreffed it through motives of duty; and lady Emma promiSed she would Soon pay her pcrSonal reSpedts to MiSs Archer.

Oil this visit lord Gore attended his j Sister, burning with curiosity to See and converSe with a woman So lovely.
So wiSe, So disinterested, as his father had represented her.	■
If the earl, at that time oS life, when desire is almost extinguished, could not behold this blaze of beauty without being Scorched, what must become of my poor friend, when the charms of MiSs Archer’s mind and perSon flashed upon him?
Once begun, he could not discontinue his visits ; but fearing the diS-pleaSure of his father, condutsted them with privacy.
I’he penetrating Emma Soon discovers the Sentiments of her brother.
Mrs. Archer warns her daughter to indulge herSelf leSs in the agreeable
company j
[ 75 ]
company of lord Gore; and the old peer begins to betray many tokens of Suspicion. Matters are tlius situated, when lady Emma confesses to the earl her brother’s involuntary paffion, and pathetically intreats he will authorize, it: her petition is neither granted nor refufed : he Sends- his daughter, to lord Gore, and gives orders that they prepare to attend, whilst he makes one more effort for the heart of MiSs Archer. Lady Emma dares not remonstrate ; she goes to her brother, tells him what she has done, and her father’s last command, beSeeching him to pardon her officiouSneSs, which was well intended, though it had not anSwered to her wishes. Racked with SuSpence, they are both under the greatest agitation, when their father E -2	fends
[ 75 ]
Sends them word the coach is ready; and on their going to attend him, he commands them, with Severity of countenance, not to open their lips in opposition to his will, being determined to conquer MiSs Archer, or oblige them to drop all intercourse with the obstinate beauty; that was his expression.
Lady Emma changed colour; my friend would have pleaded his caule, I but was forbid; and in silence they followed him to the carriage.	i
Mrs. and MiSs Archer were going I out, when their noble guest arrived ; I and meeting them at the door, would have conduced them up stairsbut lord Rainsford stepping into an apart- , ' ment below, protested he would not j stir from thence if MiSs Archer conth, )

iiucd to be cruel. See here, madam. Said he, taking lady Emma and lord Gore by the hand, I have brought my children to intreat you in my favour. Indeed, my dear girl, purSued his lordship, dropping their bands, and taking both her’s, indeed you must'she counteSs of Rainsford; but accept that title from my Son, when I am no longer able to thank you for making us all happy.
My friend, in the letters with which he honoured me, exquisitely deScribcs the Scene: for me it is impossible to do it justice. SuppoSe as much joy, gratitude and love, as a man can fup-poSe; and imagination will preSent you with this glowing pidture in Such a light as I dare not preliime to hold it.

Had not the old peer paid the debt of nature, I could have hugg*d him i for this one a6l of goodneSs, which, in about twelve months, was followed by ; his death. Whatever time he passed, from the gaieties of London, being	|
never quite detached fmm them, he	.

Many a bad mother have I known fend into the world virtuous and accomplished children. Mrs. Archer, it Seems, is not one of this number^

I never touch on this SubjeD before my wife ; but now that we are alone, continued he, I shall have a melancholy pleaSure in gratifying your curioSity. It was in yain that I was Sorry to have ashed a question, which I Saw it would give him pain to anSwer, and he proceeded.
After our marriage, we Set out di-rclstly from London for Row-Park, my father and sister in a chariot; and my wife, her mother, and mySelf, in the earl’s coach. About a mile from Mrs. Archer’s houSe, there is a very steep hill, on the Summit of which our horSes took tright, and hurried down So impetuoussy, that immediate death feemed inevitable : one of the doors bursting open, Mrs. Archer was ' ^	E 4	thrown
't
[ 8o ]	-
thrown out, and her daughter, with a loud cry, fainted ih my arms. The horSes continuing in full Speed, 1 boldly jumped Srom the coach, and happily brought her Safe, though still SenSelcSs, to the road side. GueSs the Scene of complicated horror that en-Sued; a wife and mother both lifeleSs at my feet! Suffice it to tell you. Onflow, the wheels had gone over Mrs. Archer, and that it was three months before we had hopes of her recovery. Though quite helpleSs, and a cripple, continued his lordship, there is not in the world a more entertaining companion, nor has flie lost any of that chearful Serenity Sor which she was ever distinguished.
What a vroman is here, Charles! i I am an idolater of venerable cha-
ra<sters,
[ *1 J
radlers, when accompanied with chear-SulneSs; or, to Speak my fentitnents clearer, when void of ^ morolenefs; for as to the humour, whether lively or Serious, I hold it altogether constitutional. I feel a lover-like irnf patience to kiSs the hands of Mrs. Archer, and have adtually promiScd to accompany my noble friends on their next visit. Fanny Archer, I am told, is a Sweet, blooming girl; handSomc as an angel, and gentle as mercy. Though I want no magnet to draw me thither, the fight of this young beauty will add to the pleaSure I propose at Row-Park.

You may remember, madam, that in the last moment of my happineSs,
I broke off abruptly, hearing my lord coming, as I SuppoSed, to my cloSet. Unagitated, my heart never freer from Suspicion, I waited his appearance, my pen SuSpendedin my fingers.

" With a quick step, he entered my antichamber, there stopped ; I listened,
I heard him groan, and ran, terrified, to know the reaSon. Great God? what did I there behold ! my Rains-ford, my yet dear Rainsford! thrown back in a chair; his eyes lifted, his hands extended to Heaven ; his countenance pale as the midnight Ipedlres, and Ser\ding forth piercing groans, as though the Soul and body were Suffering immediate Separation.
He Saw me not; I fell upon his neck; I bathed his face with my tears; I begged, I intreated him to -Ipeak, to tell me the cauSe of his disorder. Receiving no anfwer, and Supposing Some Sudden turn had carried off Sir Edward; Ah ! my lord, cried L -cur friend^ Sir Edward Onflow,

stow, is no morel How! Said he, without changing his position, dead! is Onflow dead ! Do not alarm your-Self, continued I, his valuable life is,
I hope, in no danger; it was your agitation only that made me fear the worst. No! no! no! replied he, and was again Silent. O Heaven! my SenSe of what I then Suffered is sh recent, it Seems not recolledtion ; my tears will flow; by their torrent my sight is overpowered.
My lord having, for Some moments, continued in agonies almost convulsive, Said, pointing to my cloSet, Go, Margaretta; leave me ; I will follow , you instantly : go! go! pray go ! I have Something to declare, the thoughts of which have quite unhinged my foul: leave me! leave me,
my
[	89. ]
my lovely Margaretta. Yes, cruel, cruel, hushand! you called me your lovely Margaretta, to make the dreadful blow you intended the more insupportable.
At his earnest intreaties, I withdrew, flattering mySelf I should Soon know from his own lips what had occasioned his distradling conflicts.
He did not keep me long in SuS-pence; but as he came towards me, my palpitating heart Seemed to forewarn me of what would happen in this interview.. You come, my dearest lord. Said I, throwing my arms about ■ him, you come to repoSe your cares in the boSom of a wife who adores you; I am intitled to a share in your affliction; hide not from me, I conjure you, what it is that disturbs you.
His
[ 9° ]
His countenance had in it Some^ thing dreadful; he sighed, he an-fwered not; he took out his handker- < chief, and turned from me. Again,
I implored he would Speak ; he attempted it, but could not. The table on which I had been writing stood before us; he took up the pen, and \vrote thus :
We part for ever.
There! there! it is done! (Said he) as if glad the horrid words had eScaped him ; and falling back in his chair,, gave me an opportunity of reading • -them, which I did, stupified with amazement. Again he took the pen, and wrote underneath the lines, on which my eyes were livetted. Search not the wound that rankles in my foul.

affliction. May all my woes be doubled. May my name be abhorred of men ; may it be blotted from the book of Heaven, if ever I wilfully divulge it.
Like one awakened from the steep of death, I Snatched the pen from his fingers j abandoned to deSpair, cried out, Revoke ! revoke! and fell, SenSev leSs, on the floor. His cries, his strenuous embraces, and the tears he shed upon my face, recalled me to life. At that moment he did not, could not, hate me. O ! that, with this thought, I had expired in his arms! It is necessary. Said he, that we part: my vow is irrevocable ! O! no, no, no,
I never can revoke it 1
Ah, madam, my miSery thus confirmed, would you SuppoSe it capable ^	of
[ 9-i ]
of addition ? Yes, I found even that was not impossible! He threv/ himSelf at my feet; and by an agony of paffion, which I had not power to withstand, exadlcd from me a promiSe not to divulge, either to his sister or his friend, our unhappy situation; the latter of whom he mentioned with tenderneSs, that Seemed to torture him. Oh! that his love had been half as steady as his friendship !
Is it possible he can be involved in dark, hidden crimes, the weight of which oppresses him ^ IS an involuntary fault hangs thus heavy on his Soul, why does he not Suffer the gentle hand of affeDion, compassion and forgiveneSs, to lift the load from his bofom? Would he but treat me with tender, generous confidence, there
may
[ 93 ]
may be yet hope, but that cruel, cruel vow, destroys it. My SuSpicions are horrid! they confound and distradt, me ! Ah, girl, girl! born for my undoing! My lord loves thee ! Yes^ madam, my ungrateful lord certainly loves MiSs Saxby I Witnefs God, I never hinted my uneafineSs till now!
I knew you would SuSpedt him ! By you, my dearest mother, I could not endure be should be fufpedted; the faults of thoSe we love become our own, with the Same caution we conceal them. It is not I, unjust Rainsford, it is thySelf who has betrayed thee. Horror! love Nancy Saxby! Too, too Sure, he loves her, or why his diS-pkaSure at my fending her from the: castle ? Why his wish of uniting her. to Sir Edward Onflow, but to deceive.
.V	me?

file ? Why his emotion, when he pressed to know if she loved Sir Edward, but from a motive of jealouSy ? Enough ! enough! I can doubt no longer: yet do not treat the unfortunate girl unkindly; perhaps she is innocent, at least there is a possibility of her not being intentionally guilty.
But what, alas, from a creature sh young. So artful. So impudent! Here I stop, it would grieve me to condemn her wrongfully.
I have been excessively ill,- yet the family SuSpefts not the caufe of my j indisposition. My lord never leaves my room but of nights, when he re- 1 tires to his own ; and carries himSelf with a tendcrneSs So truly counter^	[
fcited, that lady Emma can only	■
w'onder

I 95 j
wonder at my melancholy, without being able to difcern the reaSon.
His want of affedion to me I can but too well account for: but why does he behave to his amiable Sister with coldneSs, a coldneSs almost bordering on contempt ? Ah, what have I to do with refiedion? it sties me ef-. fedually ; or, instead of being stupi-filed with Sorrow, I should be frantic with amazement. In the fame breath that he tells me we must part, be kneels , at my feet, weeps, prays, and intreats I will not leave the castle; but I have withstood his prayers, his intreaties; and next ThurSday, my dearest, best friend, you will fee before you the most diSconSolate of wives, the most duuful of children.

Then for innocence, (the fairest flower that can adorn a female boSom) where does it blow with Such blushing, luxurious Sweetnels, as on the countenance of my Emma; attended with Such an exceSs of youth, as you cannot look on without being dazzled.

Mine, indeed, is a noble, magnificent cage ; pardon me, that I have not yet defcribed it; I think that was one of your commands.
Well then, follow me, and with your
mind’s

mind’s eye, take a view of Rainsford castle.
The situation of this edifice is Such, as makes it difficult to determine from which of the advantages I am going to mention, it receives most criibellishment.
A finely cultivated hill, that, like hospitality, extends its inviting arms on either side. A Smiling valley beneath, waving with the yellow grain of plenty. A noble park on the right ; an extensive plain on the left; from the willow-fringed streams. Softly meandering through the meadows; from the proud river, boldly Sweeping its flowing honours through the park; or from the more stately Sea, Swelling its huge Silver sides, to claim a share in the beholder’s admiration.

I Say, it wmuld be hard to deter-■ mine, to which of theSe objedis, all crowding on the fight at one view, we Sacrifice our first emotions of plea-lure and Surprize.

stately woods; one embelliSlied with temples, grottoes, fountains, and all that is beautiful in art; the other representing nature in her primitive iovelineSs, thick planted, irregular, almost inaccessible.	.	!
Another interruption ! A gentle- I man is just arrived, and enquires for me : v/hoever he is, I could, at this time, have diSpenSed with his visit; the descriptive humour js upon me. I I long to lead you through an orange-

I wish to attend you up the South terraSs, a mile in length, in height and breadth proportioned; on one hand, all the variegated Sweets of Flora; on the other, caScades falling at the distance of about two hundred yards. I would give an immensity to witneSs your astonishment at beholding this magnificent walk terminate in a fall of water, which tumbles down a rock sixty feet in height, and empties itSelf into a marble baSon beneath. Many other inimitable Scenes crowd upon my pen, but good manners, civility and curiosity, call me from it.

I went to Seek my lordj accompanied by a full heart, Swelling, as I SuppoSed, with reSentment, for the flights it had received. At every step I took towards his apartment, my reSolution Seemed to gather strength, and I felt Something like the Senfation of pleasure, when I thought I had obtained a vidlory over that affedlion, which made a Separation dreadful.
With

With theSe newly acquired Sentiments, I Sought for the perSon who had given them birth, in his chamber, in his dressing-room, in his libraryand at last my Search ended in his cloSet, where he was reclining on a Sopha, his face covered with a handkerchief.
I entered Softly, and found my courage gradually decreaSe ; but approaching nearer, ’and perceiving him fast locked in the arms of steep, I began to recover mySelf a little, and gently drew from his face hhc veil by which it was concealed.
No language can Speak my various agitations, whilst my weeping eyes; were taking a last farewell of their fondest delight. No pencil can-de-.: lineate my too lovely, too guilty^ hushand.

The windows, on account of the weather’s extreme heat, were thrown open; he lay extended before them, his cheek Supported by his hand, glowing with So inflamed a colour, as IpOke but too, too plainly, the disturbance of his foul. Part of his fine brown hair efcaping from the ribbon that bound it, beautifully shaded his forehead ; whilst part fell upon his graceful shoulders, and being expoSed to the air, waved in the most charming disorder. His eyes, where I was wont to read the Sweetest, tenderest confirmation of my happineSs, had, though cloSed, left a free passage to the drops of Sorrow, and thoSe trickled down his burning cheek in great abundance.
Judge,

Judge, madam, what, at this fights became oS your heroic daughter! Motionlefs, almost inanimate, 1 felt a total Suppression of that falfe reSenc-ment, by which, a moment before, my . Soul had been adf uated; and all my former tendernefs returned.
With my handkerchief I wiped away his tears; and kneeling by him, gave unrestrained freedom to my own. One hand that lay carelefsly extended by his side, I gently withdrew; and, by an emotion v/holly involuntary, pressed to my lips. O ! Nancy, is it you have Seduced his affedtions ? is it you, by whom he is driven from my embraces ?
Awakened by my agitation, he started, he opened his eyes, he looked ©n me with an air So languid, as redoubled

doubled all my distreSs. His confii6ls w’ere equal, if not Superior, to my own. I tried to Speak, but Sobs interrupted my words. What horror did my lord’s countenance exprels!

^OMFORT yourSclf, my beloved, my amiable child; you have yet ample room for conSolation; it is a mother’s voice bids you be comforted; it is a mother’s hand that leads you to a Spring, from whence your Soul shall fuck in the nnSullied waters of re-freshment. Why has not my child, in all her affliction, discovered this Sweet reSource ? Shall I Say from •what obstruftion she has miffed it ? Sudden and extreme Sorrow has this unhappy effed, that it throws a kind of foggy gloom over the fenSes,
which
[ <23 ]
which prevents the eye of reaSon from looking abroad, and bringing in occasions of contentment. I have shewn the cloud; Suffer me now to diSpel it.
Misfortune has not invaded you, through any unguarded part of your , condudt; no, the tyrant’s attacks have been So Severe against you, at the command of a Power irresistible! a wife and merciful God! who, when he fees fit, will turn all thoSe trials to the glory and advantage of my child.
What a heavenly companion is lelf-approbation! How many who have all your disappointments to struggle with, are denied its cheering Serenity, whilst you are rich in its possession! Do not thefe ressedlions relieve, enlighten, Sustain you ? Oh, my daugh-tpr! whether your trials are of short G 2	or
[	124 J
or long duration, deSpond not, Say not you are forSaken of Providence.
When I pray, it is for my child. When I exult, it is in my child. But when I weep, it is for her lord. Yes, the tears I shed for my innocent Mar-garetta, are few, in comparison to thoSe I give the now guilty, once amiable, Rainsford,
Fanny, poor girl, forgets her uSual extravagant fondneSs for your lord j she shudders at his name; she calls him Savage, and thinks of him with abhorrence. Her tears accompany mine, but stow not from the Same cauSe ; devoted to her injured sister, she has not one to bestow on fallen virtue. ■	'	1
Through all the intricacy of ypur lord’s reverSe of humour, I have followed
[	>25	]
lowed with an inquisitive eye; and obServe Such contrarieties, as carry me above amazement, and confound my understanding.
JealouSy, of all destrudive passions, is that which makes the greatest ravage in the human breast. A never-dying Spark, that, by degrees almost imperceptible, insinuates itSelf into boSoms unSuSpefling as your own : piety, SenSe, prudence, are no barriers to its entrance: its very heat is de-strudlive; but if it rages, the nobler pashons are often conSumed in the fatal flame.
Guard your heart, my best love, against So Subtle an enemy; and though you have reaSon to SuSpect your lord^s fidelity, do not too hastily conclude MiSs Saxby to be the objed of G 3	that
[	126 J
that infidelity. I hope, nay, I believe, Sne is innocent: her behaviour is So prudent, So diScreet, So ingenuous: the cloud that hung upon her brow is diSperSed ; she Seems reServed,’’ but her reServe is attended by Such a becoming chearfulneSs, as, in my opinion, cannot conceal guilt of So black a nature.
Your sister, last night, threw herfelf at my feet, for permission to attend you at the castle; it pained me to refuSc her, yet many reaSons obliged me CO it.
Your lord’s commands must be complied with; though, vras I only to obey the didates of maternal impatience, I should not hesitate, but bid you fly to arms joyfully opened to receive their treafure. God blefs,

I know him the re-verSe, steady and sincere : I know too, he thinks your sister, of all women on earth, the most lovely; and, of all women I know, she is most beloved by him.
Astonishment! to leave them, as I imagined, in perfed ' felicity, and hardly three days in town, before I hear they are reduced to as perfed misery ! Fain would I perSuade my-Self; my SenSes are wrapped in steep, overpowered with vrine, or even more Sacally disordered, rather than know G5	that

Dearest lady Emma, continue to bleSs me with your charming confidence, the only Satisfadion I can pof-fibly taste till I See the peace of your family restored, till I have been in Some degree instrumental to its restoration.
Your ladyship was exceedingly fortunate in discovering the retreat of
your
[ IJI ]
your brother; how much more So, in the expedient of engaging CuSack to give private intelligence oS his lord’s motions, a precaution most likely to take the cloak of obScurity from his adions.
The counteSs flatters my ambition, in Supposing I have So great a share of influence over the mind of her lord.
IS a long and steady friendship entitles me to any, by Heaven, it shall now be warmly exerted.
Family affairs, bufineSs indiSpen-Sible, prevents my Settinguut immediately for Buckman Chace; the moment I am at liberty, I fly thither ^ before that time, my letters shall reach him; Something may be gathered . from his anSwers. Depend upon it, madam, any intelligence I receive G 6	shall
[ 132 J
shall be diredly forwarded to the castle.
Ambitious you must think me, yet condemn not my preSumption; call me not a bold man, when I request, that by your ladyship’s pen, your and the counteSs’s commands might be conveyed to the honoured ,	Onslow.

LETTER XXV.
The honourable Mrs. Archer to Mar-CARETTA Countefs of Rainsford.
^^ILE! vile girl! incredulous woman ! Alas, how Severely is thy incredulity banished!
Before my endeavours, united to thoSe of my gentle, compassionate Fanny, raifed her from dejedlion, incessantly did she weep. Hypocrite ! abominable hypocrite! Who, like me, might not have been deceived ? Her fault was virtue itSelf, compared with the dreadful crime, of which I can no longer doubt her guilty; yet that fault she never ceaSed lamenting. Who could have SuSpeded the sincerity
0
[	134 )
rity of her remorfe r Never did I witneSs So much Seeming contrition!
Never will I again SuppoSe, when a young creature debates herSelf like Nancy Saxby, that she can ever riSe perfeflly clean from the mire in which she has wallowed!
Your abandoned, ungrateful lord, is no longer, my dear love, worthy of thoSe tears you daily, hourly, shed for him. A man who can So baSely deSert you, and Sor Such a wTetch! Such a deSpicable wretch! deServes no pity, much leSs the Smallest degree of ten-derneSs from my Sweet, my inestimable daughter.
Yes, my dear child, your SuSpicions are too fatally realized! Nancy Saxby is absolutely gone to the worst of men ! Why have I been So foolishly blinded ?
Never
[ 135 ]
Nevermore let me believe in the reformation of the most Specious penitent. What have I Said ! O God, forgive this petulance! Shouldst thou, for the offences of one incorrigible sinner, rejedt the prayers oS a thouSand contrite hearts, where would be thy justice, thy mercy, thy loving-kind-neSs ^ And shall I, the most unworthy of thy creatures, p;reSume to judg® the sincerity of thoSe hearts, which, perhaps. Thou, who feest all their thoughts, receivest, and pardonest!
Fanny was the first to inform me of the shocking girl’s elopement, intending, dear, considerate child, to break to me the horrid tidings by degrees ; but her face was overSpread with an air of Such mingled grief and astonishment, as gave me an immediate
alarm;
[ ]
alarm; and my inquiries after the cauSe were too Sudden and too eager forevafion. My sister ! ah, my poor Sister! Sinking down on the fide of my bed, tears streaming from her mild eyes. What, madam, will become of the counteSs ? Her cruel lord is perfidious ! Here she was silent; then taking a note from her boSom, which MiSs Saxby, in her hurry, had left upon her toilet; Read this, my dear mother, continued she, the wretch is gone to him! Read this, and account for his brutality to my sister!
I have debated, my dear Marga^ retta; long have I debated with my-felf, is I Should give you this relation. At first I was of opinion, it would only augment your affiidion, and was prompted to Supprefs it. Again, I
considered.
[ '37 J
considered, that every instance you now receive of his guilt, would strengthen your resolution to deSpiSe, perhaps forget, the author of your wrongs. TheSe thoughts determined me to conceal nothing from you; and, to assist in a conquest that may be attended with Some difficulty, I Send his billet, which the partaker of his crimes left upon her table; though wrote with evident haste and emotion, every letter, every stroke, Speaks too plainly the hand by which you are dishonoured. Read it at this place.
Dearest creature, our Separation “ is at an end. This day I have taken “ leave of the castle. Artifice will “ still be neceffary. Every thing is properly concerted. To-morrow I “ shall receive you to my arms, with
“ all
[ ^3* ]
all the impatience, all the ardour, “ of a man entirely devoted to you.
Be at the gate, my charming girl, “ to-morrow morning at Seven.’"
Observe you, my dear child, your ruined lord Says, artifice will be still necessary. Does he not herein con-feSs, that all his late assumed tender-neSs for, all his conssidls at, parting with you, all the proofs he has given of disinterestedness, by leaving you mistreSs of his houSe and fortune; has he not, I Say, declared, theSe are all the produce of mean, designing art ? To what lengths is he purSuing that art! Has he not taken, for the companion of his flight, the faithful, the deserving Cufack, whoSe principles of honour are So firmly established, that I know he would Suffer death rather
I '39 J
ther than be aiding to the infamy of his lord ^ And why has he drawn this good man after him, but as a Screen to his vices.? No, he will not bring his mistreSs home ; he will place her at Some distance, and make his vishs in privacy.
In the awful name of Virtue, there is Something So dignifying. So much to the honour of its poffeffor, that the most vicious will Submit to wear the bare cloak of hypocriSy to attain it. No wonder that lord Rainsford, who was believed the very offspring of virtue, who received all its reward of praiSes and admiration, should try to preServe its appearance, to deceive you, his friends and the world, by continuing to affed the Same discontent
t 140 1
tent with which he has withdrawn from them.	* "
You tell me he is retired to Buck-man Chace, once the Scene of his innocent amuSements, now converted to the purpoSe of his guilty pleaSures.
How do I call to mind the description you once gave me oS that rural Sdat! I think you Said it was forty miles from the castle: you Spoke too in raptures of its Sequestred situation. I thought of it then wdth delight. I think of it now with abhorrence.
Cruel lord! Why have you forfeited the large share you held in my fond affcdlion ? On you, my dearest daughter, it shall now devolve ; oh you, who, at a too high price; have purchased the addition oS parental
love.
C HI 3
love, due to the best of children from the tenderest of mothers.

EITHER bold nor preSumptuous is that friend who can So warmly interest himSelf in the unhappy situation of our family. Believe me, Sir Edward, I receive your request with that gratitude your Services demand. -I yield to it with a steadineSs due to your peculiar merit, and am commanded

Apologize not for your Surprize at the earl’s condudl; it has filled even me with indignation! Never more will I call him brother! Would to God my dear, injured Sister, could blot his idea from her memory. I ^ cannot See devouring grief prey upon her lovely cheek, without the most violent reSentment, which all her gentlenefs, all her forgiving SweetneSs, Serves but to increaSe. She chides me when I Speak freely of him ; she fays. Consider, my dear Emma, he is your brother!. he is my hushand ! let us not think too hardly of one, in V whom we have. So often gloried. Noble, generous creature! I am'
silenced
f HS 1
silenced by her rebuke 1 I gaze on her with admiration : my sighs, my tears, fay how much I am affeisted,
I cannot look back on what your, or wshat my Rainsford has been, without dying away at the thought of what he now is !
, Good God! out of what fluctuating matter does Providence form the dispositions of its creatures! One day virtuous, another, depraved; this hour happy, the following, miserable ; now laughing, now weeping; one moment Serene and unshfpedfing, the next, diScompofed, and the prey of Suspicion!
I think it would be an addition to our misfortunes, were they made public. Nothing has yet tranSpired. The irigrate has flown to a place, ,
where
[	J44 3
where he often retires to enjoy thoSc innocent amuSements, for which he must have now lost all relish. Yet I do not expedl the Argus eyes of a Scrutinizing world will be always cloSed, or that fame will forget her office.
I am Summoned to lady Rainsford; she begs I will come to her immediately. Is it possible any thing can have happened to increaSe her Sufferings ? Nothing, I greatly Sear, will ever alleviate them.
Heaven and earth! for whom do you think the lovely, diScreet, accomplished, countefs, is forSaken ? Why, for Nancy Saxby! Yes, Nancy Saxby, his ward! the aukward, wretched, uneducated, Nancy Saxby; that Same lowering, down-looking girl, you once Said you would not call your wife,
your

your daughter, or your sister, for the imiverSe: yes, her! O Rainsford I Rainsford! now indeed art thou fallen! I can Say no more on the hateful Subjedl. Mrs. Archer’s letter, which I am permitted to incloSe, will Speak too much!
Have you read it. Sir Edward ? Has not your compassionate heart bled? Have not your eyes streamed ■at the contents ? Blessed Mrs. Archer! Angelic woman! do not deSpiSe me for the Sake of one I cannot now think on without horror!
Man! insinuating, designing, fickle, man ! Pardon me. Sir Edward, I am going to be Severe'PBut is it not true ? Ah! have we mot a too recent example, that man is insinuating, designing, fickle? In early acquaintance, aflidu-Vot. I.	H	ous.
[ 146 ]
Otis, exadf, officious, full of refpe<5l; poffeffed of what he has once purSued with ardour, what Succeeds ? Ah, God! cannot lady Rainsford inSorm you.
Perhaps my pen might take too great a licence, was I to indulge my preSent ^ humour : I will no longer indulge it; Such Subjeds cannot affed Sir Edward Onflow, but may be ungrateful to him.
When you write to the^ infatuated criminal, be on your guard, or he will be too much So on his, for us to make that ample diScovery of his guilt after which I am now Seeking. Do not hint to him the least of our Suspicions, nor mention the detested name of Saxby.

TETTER XXVII.
Sir Edward Onslow to Colonel Onslow.
A Moment later, my brother, and your application would have been fruitless; but, as it happens, I hope to congratulate you on its SucceSs before I cloSe my letter.
Having received your commands,
J posted away to the Secretary of war, H 2	with
■ , [	148	]
with as much expedition as if the visit had been designed to my mistreSs. Hardly had I preferred my petition ^ to his lordship, and stated matters in their true colours, when in came the
duke of------, in his night-gown and
flippers, to Solicit the Same favour for lord John, his grace’s Second Son, not three months since preferred to a company in the guards ; a stripling, v;ho 'has never Seen an engagement, except at the play-houSe, or a tavern.
From the father of this young hoper ful I had a flight inclination of the head, as he passed into another apartment, to which he was attended by the Secretary, who had not yet either granted or refuSed my petition.
My expectations were SuSpended between hope and fear, though lean-

insj considerably to the latter, when I overheard my lord apolcg'zingto his. grace, and affunng him, the regiment was promised; on which the noble Solicitor withdrew, leaving behind ^, him a certain complacency of fiz with which he entered, a mash that great men are ever prone to wear on Such OccasiORS..
When I Saw his grace Sent away dissatisfied, you may SuppoSe 1 lost all thoughts of Succeeding; and I Said, as the Secretary returned from attending him to the door. Well, my lord, I have, I can have no hopes for my brother : your lordship’s anSwerto the
duke I have heard, and---------
It is true, replied our worthy friend, interrupting me, I did tell his grace, the regiment in which your brother H 3	is
, [ '5° ]
is lieutenant colonel, was promiSed; it was enough that I knew the merit of that gentleman to determine me it should be his. The nation, continued he, is not indebted to lord John; to Mr. Onflow it owes many and Singular Services. This exceSs of justice, generosity, and politeneSs, binds me to him eternally. He is now adlually waiting on the king for his majesty's approbation.
A message from his lordship; he' desires to See me immediately : I obey the Summons, and hope, at my return, to confirm your promotion.
Well, Charles, I not only wish you joy of Succeeding, but have the pleasure of dispatching theSe agreeable tidings in the packet that carries the
royal
t '5‘ ]
royal mandate for your return to England.
MiSs Edgerton is inclinable to defer her nuptials still your arrival; but Robert is So impatient to command, at least to be Second in command, that I believe we must get her to sign his commiffion, without your being a witneSs.
Colonel R—st regiment is ordered to relieve you with all possible expedition : prepare therefore for your embarkation; you can have no friend who will receive you and your fair fellow traveller, on the British shore, with greater joy, than Onssow.

Why did I not reveal it Sooner! Something of fear, of timidity : God ! I hardly know what it was that withheld me!
Poor, inSenfible infant! where is now thy father.? where is now my hushand.? Thou hast a father, yet wilt be born an orphan. I have a hushand, yet must hug thee to my widowed boSom!
Lady Emma knows this increaSe to . my Sorrows; kind, excellent, lady Emma! Her tenderneSs Supports me when my Spirits Suffer the most cruel H 5 dejedlion;

dejeflion ; she throws aside her natural gaiety, as a robe which is put on and off at pleaSure, and becomes the philosophical reaSoner, the confoling companion. For her Sake, methinks, I could pardon any thing but premeditated vice, if a reconciliation on her brother’s side had been attempted ; but now honour forbids I should ever Suffer his expostulations, or even entertain a thought in favour of him !
O heavens 1 why was I So ready to promote my own destrudlion ? Why did I Snatch the wretch from her paramour ^ Had they gone together, how many evils might have been avoided ! My lord was then but Second in her low estimation ! That very day on which he abandoned me to all the horrors of my fate, the fellow who
shared

shared with him the favour of the worst oS creatures, feeing his lordship leave the castle, burst into my chamber, where I had retired to indulge my grief; and in an agony, if poshble, greater than my own, threw himSelf at my feet; I come, madam. Said he, to implore your ladyship’s pardon for crimes almost too black for mercy. I have deceived you. MiSs Saxby has deceived you. Your lord injures you. No, you cannot pardon me. Heaven guard your ladyship. I go, but my prayers shall be with you.
I was So astonished at his appearance and words, that he was gone before I had power to reply. I Sent after him, but he had left the castle. Saxby’s elopement explained his meaning.

The first perSon I met was the faithful CuSack, whoSe joy, at Seeing me, ran over at his eyes; and from him I learnt that my lord had not left his bed.

Sir Edward, replied the good Cu-Sack, I have ventured to hint your disappointment; he was angry at my boldneSs, and called me officious old man; the next moment he condescended to aSk my pardon, threw his arms about me, and declared I was dear to his Soul, but Said he could not now bear contradidlion. Here the worthy creature wiped his eyes, whilst I was almost Softened to as great a I 5	degree;
[
degree; then lifting them to Heaven, he cried. Merciful God, restore my beloved lord to himSelS! to his Suffering counteSs ! to his friend! to the world ! to happineSs !
Most fervently did I join in his devout ejaculation; and having considered a moment, I desired he would condudt me to the door of his lord’s apartment: this he readily complied with ; and leaving me there, retired at a distance.
I Saw him, through the key-hole, traversing his chamber, with an emotion that his very step betrayed. When he heard my voice, intreating him to admit me in the most moving terms of friendssiip, his Sobs were audible. I repeated them; he came towards the door; he took the lock
in

in his hand; again he quitted it hastily, and turned away: a long time he Seemed quite irreSolute, now advancing, now retreating; I still importuning him for entrance. He came once more to the door; and, < just as I thought him about to admit me, he stopped short, and cried out, in a kind oS frantic accent, No! it shall not be open’d ! I will not lee this generous, this kind, this honourable I’riend! by all the holy Saints, I will not! Hold! hold! my lord, interrupted I, what have you Said ! Nothing, returned he, but what are my most firm and steady reSolves!

Shall I confeSs to you, ladies, that when Sir Edward came to this part of his recital, I Selt mySelf agitated by a fenlation not unlike pity ! Again it returns! I must give way to its Soft pleadings! You do not See me weep ! but indeed, indeed, I am guilty! The remorSe of this perfidious brother touches me with compassion!

IS Mrs. Archer should disapprove theSe Sentiments, let her correct them, and permit me to return to my conference with Sir Edward.
Something, lady Emma, continued he, lies concealed in the mind of lord Rainsford ! O God ! may I never entertain a thought which I dare not reveal to my friend! Did he think I would preSume to rested, to upbraid Did he think I should baSely expoSe him ? If not, what a cruel diffidence is his!
I left the houSe, filled with more Sorrow than reSentment at my unkind
reception;

reception; without hinting to CuSack, who Saw me to the door, any SuSpicion of his lord’s amour with MiSs Saxby.
1 enquired of him about the neighbourhood; and finding it chiefly consisted of farm-houSes and little hamlets, I took my leave, determined to discover the horrid girl’s retreat.
All that day my Search lasted, but to no purpeSe; the meanest cottage did not eScape inSpedion, my enquiries were So particular; and when the inhabitants anSwered to my questions,
I watched every turn of their countenance with So quick penetration, that . if her guilty abode had been within five miles of my lord’s Seat, it is impossible I could have miffed it.
My expedition cloSed with the day.
It was late when I returned to my
inn,
[	1^4 ]
inn, where I rested that night; and the next morning, making another fruit-IcSs attempt to See your brother, I hastened towards the castle. He was going to Say Something more, when my sister appeared in a walk before the window; and being aSraid she would Surprize us, we went immediately to join her.
The lovely. Sorrowing counteSa, whoSe situation is now visible, caught the eye of our friend as she moved to-w'ards us. He examined her shape with penetration that did not eScape me ; noc could I overlook the manly concern, pity and tenderneSs, which eloquently Spoke upon his countenance. Sir Edward Onflow, my dearest Sister! stepping forward as he stood wrapped in silent wonder, his hands
and
[ iS5 ]
and eyes lifted to Heaven, Will you not tell our valuable friend he is welcome
Sir Edward, Said she, going up to him with an air of the most piercing melancholy, this visit is kind, exceedingly kind. His eyes were full; his heart, I am Sure, was full alSo. He tried to Speak, but could not utter a Syllable.
Generous, good Sir Edward! continued she, laying her hand on his, SuppreSs your friendly concern. Strange alterations have happened since we
last met on this Spot, but---She was
proceeding, when Sir Edward, by his example, occaSioned Such a Scene of Silent woe, as cannot be deScribed.
Thank God, she was more com-poSed, and Sir Edv/ard more himSelf;
when
t >86 ]
when I left them together, in order to tranSmit thoSe particulars to Row-Park, my memory being never very bright, at this time more than commonly dull.
Sir Edward leaves us in a few hours; he is still with the counteSs. This instant they are come in sight of my windows: she is leaning on his arm; I fear she will Suffer too much Satigue ; I will go to them, and per-Suade her not to walk longer. What can he have been Saying ? what comfort administered? Never Saw I Such an alteration! Her charming countenance Seems to have lost a degree of its uSual melancholy : I go to know whence this gleam of pleaSure ariSes; I SuppoSe from Some innocent artifice of Sir Edward to lull her into hope.

JNDEED, my dear girl, the tender affed'ion which, like a healing balm, you would pour into my disappointed mind, instead oS anSwering the Salutary purpoSe you intend, has added a Smarting pain to what I felt before.
Can my Sympathising Fanny Sup-post, that by paffing her days in Solitude, avoiding mankind, and giving
up
L I?8	]
up her gentle boSom to fell Suspicion, my distreSs will diminish ? O no ! it can only Serve to increaSe it.
Retradl, my Sister, from a reSolution which has So much alarmed me! When a man addresses you on the Score of love, hear him without prejudice ! Think not of my lot, when you question your heart how it stands affedled towards him! Think not of lord Rainsford when you give an an-Swer, whether encouraging, or the re-verSe. Perhaps you hold it early enough to entertain Serious refiecstions on theSe matters; certainly no time has elapSed which So prudent a young creature would regret, but my Fanny is now shooting into vroman. I ordy mean by what I have insinuated, that she should not rejedl a worthy man, one
who
[	>89	]
who will make her happy, becauSe I have been unfortunate.
Think me not So unjust, So narrow minded, as to involve his whole Sex in the perfidy of my lord. He, as you observe, has fallen ! I know ! I feel that he is humbled! But let me not with one drag down a multitude, whoSe footing may be Secured on the rock of virtue.
O, my dearest Sister, whenever you leave the single state, may your early proSpedls, like mine, bloom with luxurious happineSs ; but prevent it. Heaven ! that, like mine, they wither in the bud, fade, and untimely die, by the chilling blast of disappointment.

LETTER XXXVII.
Margaretta Countefs of Rainsford to the honourable Mrs. Archer.
SIR Edward Onflow, who has the most humane and tender heart that ever man poffeffed, has just left the castle. His prefence has revived me; and a certain diScovery I have made of his inclinations, gives me new life : his visst was equally unex-• pedted by lady Emma and my Self; she brought him to me as I was walking in the garden; and Soon after left us together, too much Softened by a Icene which I will not here attempt to describe. Sir Edward offered me his
arm ;
[ '91 ]
arm ; I accepted it, and we continued outwalk.
Tell me, Sir, Said I, Seeing him deeply and silently affeded by my distress ; tell me, if, together with my own, it is necessary I should loSe the chearfulneSs of my friends ? Perceive you not how much is flown of lady Emma’s vivacity ?
I See, I honour, I adore her fenSi-bility, replied he, a conScious glow rising on his manly cheek.
But indeed, continued I, you both Sacrifice too largely on the altar of friendship: why am I So unfortunate as to involve all who are conneded with me in my astlidion ^
Better, madam, returned Sir Edward, your friends Suffer with you, than that you should lavish your
esteem
A ;
[	192	]
esteem on wretches devoid of humanity ; by Heaven, he who stands a calm, unconcerned Spedfator, of lady Rainsford’s trials, deServes not the appellation of human! Can Onflow, can lady Emma, indulge a look, a thought of gaiety, whilst you weep ?
, Can a Spark of joy light in their bo-Som, which your tears will not extinguish ?
Had you Seen his fervour at this moment, you vrould not wonder, my ' dearest mother, that it touched mv very foul; and I Said with energy equal to his own.
My dear friend! my amiable Sister! you mnst both be happy, whatever is my fate. An union oS Soul, of Sentiment, of manners. Speaks the design of Heaven, when it found a pair So
perfedt.
[ m ]
perfect. Sir Edward, you love lady Emma; I have discovered your paS-fion in this short interview. May she reward it! may your virtues be the reward of each other.
Ke fell at my feet, and pressing my hands to his lips, SurpisiSed me with this reply ; For Heaven’s Sake, lady Rainsford, as you are .mistreSs of my Secret, confine it in your own breast-let it not eScape, to betray me to your charming- Sister.
Flow! Sir Edward, Said I, obliging him to riSe, can you love my sister, and determine to conceal your preference? Can you rish her favour, which, whilst you are silent, she may possibly bestow on a leSs- deServing rival ? Let me intreat you will not
VoL. I.	K	remain
[	194	]
remain in SuSpence, when in your power to be aSfured.
Lady Emma, madam, returned he, is dear to me as my Soul; yet shall I talk to her of love, when she is oppressed with grief? Shall I entertain her with proposing happineSs to our-Selves, whilst you are miserable ? No, lady Rainsford ! before I declare ,my ambitious hopes, I must approve my-SelS not unworthy the title of a faithful lover, by deServing that of a steady . friend. He was proceeding, when lady Emma, always Solicitous for my health, came to chide me for having walked too long, and\ our conversation became general.
I am mortified that Sir Edward will not discover his attachment to my fister, still my affairs have taken a
more
C <95 ]
mcJr^ favourable turn : alas! what favourable turn can they take ? Why poiSon his own felicity by waiting an event which can never happen? Was ever friendship So fervent. So delicate, as Sir Edward’s ? About four years since, this amiable young man met a Severe disappointment in love, Something of which he accidentally hinted to lady Emma : she ashed him for the particulars; he politely begged to be excuSed from wasting moments So precious to him in dull narrative; but promised, as Soon as he went from the castle, he would obey her with ex-adlneSs, making it a matter of favour that she would condefeend to interest herfelf in his concerns. Poor lady Emma! I believe at that moment she felt a certain SoftneSs, of which her K z	heart
C '9S ]
heart was conScious; for colouring excessively, she dropped the topic with as much precipitation as a child lets • fall the burning coal with which he has Scorched his finger,?. Though all nty fond expectations are flown, to the happineSs of my friends I cannot be infenfible. When I think of an alliance between lady Emma and Sir Edward, I feel unuSual plcafure. In the felicity of others I may yet rejoice, but never, never, can I forget my Own misfortune.

Alas, I have others to relate, which, in obedience to your commands, I dare not SuppreSs j though, my good young lady, I know they will astlidt you greatly.

I was

I was not much disappointed when liis lordship failed to return at the liour of dinner, becauSe he has often absented himSclf in like manner; but my apprehensions v:ere terrible when night came fast upon me ; and I ventured out in purSuit oS him without SucceSsj nor did I again See his honoured face still between five and six o’cjock the next morning. In what a Situation did I then behold him! Ah, lady Emma, the counteSs would have died with grief, had she Seen her dear lord as I Saw him, pale, fainting, trembling, eyes ‘'streaming,’ breast heaving, hands lifted, and, withal. Such a dreadful fierceneSs in his looks, as terrifies me to recoiled.
Since that fatal moment, he has not eat, he has not drank, he has not 4	ssept,

siept, I may fay, he has harcdy Spoke. What fearful accident has he now encountered to work up his Soul to Such a pitch of unutterable disorder ? Pardon, madam, the preSumption of your Servant; I would give up the remainder of my days to know, and to remove the cauSe of his deSpondency.
The bell from his apartment this moment SummonSes me.
His lordship is better, madam. O my excellent lady, how I rejoice to Send you thoSe tidings! He has Spoke , to me; he has called me his faithful friend; my old heart bounds at the honour it receives.
Heaven be praifed, my lord continues to mend; he is much better, much more compoSed: he has ordered
chocolate,

chocolate, and Says he will try to refresh himSelf by sseep.
My aged knees Snail bend to Heaven for the restoration of his peace, and the peace of his counteSs, who, for the last five weeks, he has never ceaSed to mention, in terms So tender. So pathetic, as quite unmans me. I retire to a humble distance; there I watch his motions. As he stands gazing on the beautiful portrait of his beloved lady, with the big tears rolling down his cheeks, I feel my boSom heaving with concern, and my face moistened by compassion.

My next talk is to obey your commands in regard to CuSack; I shall execute them with pleaSure; it is a. mark of confidence that will not only make the good old .man happy, but alSo give a keener edge to his attention. He will observe my brother’s adions with a more penetrating eye, Ci /	and
[ 2o6 ]
and not let the most trivial circumstance efcape his notice.
I have formed, in the airy regions of fancy, many confuSed ideas, to ac-' count for his lordship’s abSence from Buckman Chace, and the horrible disorder in which he returned thither ; and at last I have fixed on one which Seems to wear at least an air of probability. Perhaps he had been that very day with the vile, prostituted Saxby. As to Sir Edward’s insisting she is no where concealed in the neighbourhood, he may be mistaken, he may have been misinformed. Let me then go on with my Supposition. •Perhaps, in this interview, she may have offended his lordship : words, perhaps, roSe high; a parting might have been the conSequence, and this
very
[ 2°7 ]
very parting may have occasioned his difcompoSure. Horrid wretch! after his first infatuation, to what lengths may he not be carried by his blind, abSurd, ridiculous passion 1
When I refiedl: on the ingratitude, the folly, the vices of this man, I forget that he is my brother ; I forget that I ever loved him ; I think of him with horror, and every Sentiment of pity is extinguished in my boSom.
My indignation ariSes So fast, that if I do not drop my pen, it will paSs the boundaries to which I would ever confine it.

'Y"OUR ladyfitip’s commands were a brace of gold and Silver phea« Sants, a Virginia nightingale, parrot, and Canary birds ; all of which have now the honour of attending you, im hopes to peck a delicate morSel from the loveliest, fairest hands in the uni-verSe.
Every morning, iS you allure them with the music of your voice, they will hover round your window,, having all the gentleneSs of your Sex, all ^ the ambition of ours. Were they

giSted with Speech, and not inSenSible to gratitude, how many thouSand acknowledgments might I expedt for removing them Srom Carey Grove to Rainsford Castle! No doubt, they would insist on my naming a reward for So signal a Service : I would name it; and this it should be; to the phea^ Sants I v/ould give it in charge, I would command them on their duty, whenever lady Emma walked the verdant lawn, to run before, to diSplay their variegated plumage, and entertain the enchanting eye of their fair mistreSs. The nightingale should Sooth, and Canary birds divert, her melancholy. The parrot’s talk is yet unassigned ; Sorgive my boldneSs, madam, if it might be permitted, that it ' ^	^should

should Sometimes preSume to remind you of On stow.
Your ladyship has Seen my brother Robert. IS you remember, madam,
I had the honour of introducing him to you in his way to London. I am just come from assisting at his nuptials, an event which he has taken pains to celebrate with that Spirit of liberality peculiar to his profession, a profession of which he is no dishonourable member. Has your lady-ship any curiosity to know the manner in which it was condutsted ^
Cornelly’s apartments being previ- . ousiy beSpoke, and properly decorated, the bride and bridegroom adjourned thither from St. James’s chapel about eleven, where they were faluted by a
numerous
[ 211 ]
numerous assembly brought together by a general invitation.
Breakfast and a band of music cloSed the morning; after which we were regaled with a profusion of elegancies at the Star and Garter.
On my conScience, I believe all the admirals, commodores and captains, in the navy, with their wives, Sweethearts, daughters. Sisters and cousins, for Seven generations, were preSent on this occasion.
Mrs. Onflow Seemed highly pleaSed with her office, or I should have greatly pitied her expence of Spirits. To confeSs a truth, in justice to my nev/ sister, I never Saw any woman acquit herSelSwith more eaSc, grace, and good humour.
I ho-
[ 212 ]
I honour the judgment of my brother ; and indeed he appeared to honour it himst'if, by the honest pleaSurc he betrayed in his eyes whenever they encountered thoSe of his bride ; yet, lady Emma is neither young, nor very handSome; on the contrary,, thirty-five years has she been improving a disposition naturally Sweet and amiable, amply Supplyingthe defeffes of perSon by Such intelleDual qualifications as captivate the whole Soul of a worthy creature, whoSe study, I am-convinced, will be to make her happy.
I can admire, I can revere, good nature, judgment, wit; but ah, my charming friend, how much stronger have I experienced their force when enshrined in the Snowy boSom, darting from the keen eye, or stealing from.
the^
[ ii3 ]

It would be folly, it would be mad-neSs, to resist the power of tlieSe united graces: shew me the man who ^could behold them, and keep his freedom : :shew me the man who would even wish to keep it: he must be stupidly inSenfible, a wretch indeed, who would not glory in Such captivity.
I avoid Speaking oS your brother, madam; if J aSk concerning him, of what can your ladyship inform me? What alteration can we yet expedl ? For a happy one, I offer up my warmest wishes ; I offer them from various motives, interested and disinterested. Lady Rainsford knows my heart; she only can judge with what unaffedled fervency I offer them^
I dare
[ JI4 ]
I dare not trust mySelf on this Sub-jedt j I shall be too preSuming.
Adieu, my lovely correspondent. Tell the countcSs, she has not in the world a friend more Sincere, more devoted to her Service, than Onflow,' Request, that she will command him freely.
