# Early Novels Digital Collection

## About the collection

The first installment of Penn Libraries' [Digital Collection of British and American Fiction](<http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/print/index.html>), curated by Alice Tweedy McGrath and Lindsay Van Tine, represents a varied cross-section of eighteenth-century epistolary fiction in English. Twenty-five titles are available to researchers in digital form for the first time, including many unique works such as *The Labyrinths of Life* (1791) and *Letters from Clara: or, the Effusions of the Heart* (1771); a further 11 represent unique editions of titles such as *The Wreath of Friendship, or a Return from India* (1790) and Eliza Haywood's *Love in Excess: or, the Fatal Enquiry* (1721). The remaining 37 titles, including lesser-known epistolary novels by anonymous or women authors and epistolary collections published before 1740, are not freely available in text form.

This digital collection follows in the eclectic spirit of the corpus from which it is drawn, the Kislak Center's Collection of British and American Fiction (1660-1830), which began with the personal libraries of Godfrey F. Singer and John C. Mendenhall, both scholars from the English Department of the University of Pennsylvania in the 1930s. As collectors, Singer and Mendenhall aimed at breadth; they sought not only early editions by well-known authors like Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding but also obscure and anonymous titles gleaned from bookseller’s advertisements and circulating library catalogues. The resulting Singer-Mendenhall Collection, augmented over the years by other curators and donors, is one of the most comprehensive and interesting collections of early English fiction in the world.

In choosing works to digitize we have also set our sights beyond the canon to unique and unknown titles. One of our selection criteria is anonymity: while most eighteenth-century fiction was published anonymously, most titles that were reprinted and re-collected have subsequently found an author's name. Over time, as authorship has become an increasingly important factor in conferring value, the existence of such a name might both indicate and perpetuate temporal endurance. By prioritizing insistently anonymous works in our curation we hope to counteract the canonical slant of most digital collections.

Among the many anonymous works in the collection, we chose a subset of titles that specify author gender without specifying name. Titles such as *The Mutability of Human Life* (1777) and *The Prude* (1724), published with the author attribution of “a lady” and “a young lady" (respectively), might offer fodder for considering not only practices of authorial naming but also the common trend of associating the epistolary novel with women readers and writers. In *The Denouement: or, the History of Lady Louisa Wingrove* (1781) the anonymous author describes herself as "another pen in petticoats" and delights in her own anonymity; other unnamed "ladies" such as *The Maiden Aunt* (1776) and *The Example: or the History of Lucy Cleveland* (1779) also offer facetious or sincere prefatory apologies for publishing while female.

The works in this collection offer a sample glimpse of a genre in a state of flux and self-justification. Many of these works contain in their front matter preliminary paratexts in which authors reflect upon the increasing ubiquity of novels, or attempt to distinguish their work from the mass of newly-published fiction. The dedication to *Frederick and Alicia* (1791) laments that that “novels are become in general (perhaps through their multitude) insipid, and scarcely fit for perusal,” and hopes for better reception from the dedicatee. The never-before-digitized *Constantia and her daughter Julia* (1769) takes the opposite tack: the prefatory “Discourse on Romances” defends the genre of ‘romance’ by claiming that history is yet more absurd and less interesting, though another piece of front matter claims that it is a story based on fact.

Though prose fiction was "rising" in prestige through the middle decades of the eighteenth-century, the word "novel" on a title page still proclaimed belonging to a dubious category. A substantial number of these titles (published in the 1760s and 1770s) include the word "novel". At least 16 works -- many of them unique copies -- were published by proprietors of circulating libraries such as Francis and John Noble, Thomas Lowndes, and William Lane. Scholars have noted the importance of these institutions in the development of the novel marketplace as well as their centrality within public discourses that decried novels as a corrupting influence. Both factors -- and possibly female authorship as well -- may have conferred genre legibility without conferring prestige: while they represent important strands of the market for epistolary fiction, few have endured in reprints or on syllabi. We hope that  making this collection of titles available for reading and text analysis will open up possibilities for the study of prose fiction in all its idiosyncrasies.
